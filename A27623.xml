            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Scripture Line of Time,</hi> which I affirm, is that, which riſes from the excellent State of <hi>All Things</hi> at <hi>Creation;</hi> when followed an immediate Deordination, flowing from the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> and <hi>Fall of Man</hi> through the <hi>Serpents Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> But by the interpoſal of the <hi>Promiſed Seed of the Woman,</hi> That State was borne up from utter Ruine, and ſinking, and a Proſpect gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of a Reſtitution of all Things by a <hi>new Creation,</hi> when the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents Head</hi> ſhould be <hi>bruis'd;</hi> Now of this <hi>Reſtitution, all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets</hi> have been <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> ſince the <hi>Worlds Beginning,</hi> and they have led along the Courſe of things to it, in the Exaltation of Him, whoſe <hi>Name is the Word of God,</hi> (the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of the written Word) till He appears encircled with <hi>many Crowns,</hi> Revel. 19. At which, <hi>That old Serpent,</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>Sathan,</hi> is <hi>laid hold</hi> upon, <hi>chain'd,</hi> and <hi>ſeal'd up</hi> within his proper <hi>Abyſs,</hi> or <hi>Bottomleſs Pit,</hi> and the <hi>New Creation</hi> is eſtabliſh'd in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this <hi>Many-Crown'd King.</hi> Which <hi>Kingdom</hi> can never <hi>be broken,</hi> nor leaves a poſſibility of any <hi>Succeſſion</hi> to it ſelf; But it is <hi>deliver'd up</hi> into the Hand of the <hi>Father,</hi> from which it is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd;</hi> before which <hi>Delivery,</hi> or <hi>Reſignation,</hi> ſhall be the perfect and final <hi>Contuſion</hi> of the <hi>Serpents Head;</hi> Himſelf, and all his Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, not <hi>written in the Book of Life,</hi> being <hi>caſt</hi> with <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell into the Lake of Fire,</hi> which <hi>is the ſecond Death,</hi> Rev. 20.
<pb facs="tcp:41903:3"/> This <hi>bleſſed State</hi> therefore is not a ſingle <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but a <hi>Sabbatiſm</hi> of a <hi>thouſand years,</hi> that <hi>remains to the People of God,</hi> conjoyn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably with the <hi>Sabbatiſm</hi> of <hi>Eternity,</hi> even as the <hi>ſeventh day Sabbath of the Creation</hi> was connected with, united in, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſucceeded by the <hi>Chriſtian firſt day Sabbath,</hi> or <hi>Our Lords Day, at his Reſurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Line of Time</hi> I then avow, is drawn from that former <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> of the <hi>Firſt Creation,</hi> to the <hi>Sabbatiſm</hi> of the <hi>New Creation,</hi> as from <hi>Point to Point,</hi> without Oſtentation, or formal Profeſſion of ſuch a <hi>Line;</hi> yet ſo that it is all along, and eſpecially the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Joynts of the parcel, and particular <hi>Lines,</hi> are ennobled with ſome illuſtrious <hi>Symbols</hi> of the down fall of <hi>Sathans Kingdom,</hi> and of the <hi>Glory of the Kingdom of the Seed,</hi> or of the <hi>Teknogony</hi> of the <hi>Woman,</hi> as may be abundantly made good in all Inſtances.</p>
            <p>At what I have aim'd, and for what end in the calculation of this <hi>Line,</hi> I have prepared a full Diſcourſe, may be ſeen by the <hi>Calendar</hi> annexed to this Preface, what I have perform'd may be ſeen hereafter, if God permit the Publication of that Preparation upon the whole <hi>Line.</hi> At this Time I have only preſented my Endeavours upon that grand <hi>Prophetick Line</hi> of <hi>Daniels</hi> 2300 Evenings Mornings, which is by the admirable contrivance of the Divine Wiſdom given firſt entire, and ſo preſerv'd, as not to be under any ſuch Prejudice from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable variation of <hi>Copies,</hi> as the <hi>Ages</hi> of the <hi>Patriarks</hi> are; and then the parcel or collateral <hi>Lines</hi> either in <hi>number'd Numbers,</hi> or as I hope, will appear on very good Proof, riſe exactly adequate to the 2300; ſo that the whole, and the Parts demonſtrate, and aſſure one another; beſides I vouch thoſe undoubted, and indiſputable Lines, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated</hi> in the <hi>Calendar,</hi> as far, as to <hi>Cyrus</hi> indiſputable, I do not mean ſo much, when they began, or how much Time they comprehend, For ſo I know there are many Doubts through Difference of <hi>Copies,</hi> or otherwiſe, but in this indiſputable, that <hi>Holy Writ</hi> hath taken care there ſhould be an Account of Time ſo far. And this I vouch, as an Argument, That he who begun a <hi>Line</hi> from the <hi>Creation,</hi> continued it to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and defin'd by <hi>ſeventy weeks</hi> the ſpace from the <hi>word going forth</hi> to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> hath every where fill'd it up, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued it to the <hi>Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſeeing he as eaſily commands
<pb facs="tcp:41903:3"/> Time future by <hi>Prophecy,</hi> as Time past by <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> and I do find both are certain and definite, to that preciſeneſs, as to be twice, once in <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> once in <hi>Prophecy,</hi> ſaid to be the <hi>ſelf ſame day,</hi> viz. the <hi>coming out of Egypt,</hi> Exod. 12. 40. and the <hi>Viſion of the New Jeruſalem.</hi> Ezek. 40. 1.</p>
            <p>And that very <hi>Charactariſm</hi> of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> 390, and 40 <hi>days, lying</hi> on his <hi>two ſides,</hi> I look upon as an eſpecial contrivance of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to mediate between the <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> and <hi>Prophetick</hi> Pares of Time, that being part <hi>Hiſtorick,</hi> viz. to the <hi>Time</hi> of the <hi>Siege</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and more or leſs ſo to that <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> and of very great <hi>Symbolical</hi> Importance alſo concerning the ſtate of the <hi>Twelve Tribes,</hi> till the <hi>Times of the Gentiles,</hi> that entred in <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzars Univerſal Monarchy,</hi> were <hi>fulfill'd;</hi> of all which, with the anſwer of all Doubts, upon that and other the <hi>Viſions</hi> of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> relating to Time, I have at large treated in that afore promis'd Diſcourſe, only I cannot omit the <hi>Prophetical Cypher of Time,</hi> tranſlated from the 40 <hi>Days</hi> for <hi>forty years in the Wilderneſs</hi> is here ſolemnly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with its <hi>Key,</hi> as of perpetual Scripture uſe from thence.</p>
            <p>I can with great Truth and Sincerity, make Proteſtation; It was no part of my Deſign to enter a Diſpute with any <hi>Perſwaſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> but only to purſue the <hi>Line of Time,</hi> as it reaches that illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Sabbatiſm,</hi> for which I find, Eminent Perſons of all <hi>Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> have very great Favour.</p>
            <p>But doing this, I could not avoid, but that the <hi>Antichriſtian Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy,</hi> as ſeated in the <hi>City,</hi> that in the Time of the <hi>Revelation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and its <hi>Prince,</hi> are ſo <hi>fathally</hi> enwrap'd in all parts of <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> that they muſt be every where attack'd, yet I have taken care to do it only in the Terms and Phraſes of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and as the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Explication of it, and its Times enforc'd.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, I had no ſuch Intention, I find no Diſcourſes upon, or againſt that <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> in any degree comparable either in clearneſs, or aſſurance, if disjoyn'd from <hi>Prophecy,</hi> as when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd with it, either for determination of <hi>Theological, Doctrinal</hi> Controverſies, or Differences in <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> or <hi>Chronology,</hi> as when ſuch corrupt <hi>Doctrines, ſuperſtitious Innovations in Chriſtian Worſhip, Uſages,</hi> and <hi>Uſurpations</hi> in <hi>Chriſtian Diſcipline,</hi> entred the World, and at what rate of Detestation they ought to be
<pb facs="tcp:41903:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> Had; All theſe are more certainly and more briefly reſolv'd, when <hi>Prophecy</hi> hath the umpirage; for little Intimations either deriv'd from Grounds of <hi>Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or from <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Opinion,</hi> when <hi>Prophecy</hi> inclines, with them, or ſuppoſes things agreeably with them; will weigh againſt vaſt Volumes on the other ſide, with which <hi>Prophecy</hi> propends not; Thus I am much more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd, by obſerving what is after fully diſcours'd from <hi>Prophecy</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Image-worſhip,</hi> however palliated; that it is that ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted <hi>Idolatry,</hi> forbidden in the <hi>ſecond Commandment,</hi> then from all Rational Diſcourſes with <hi>Prophecy,</hi> however grounded on <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> but not compar'd without <hi>Prophecy</hi> for a fuller Interpretation of it. I am much more aſſur'd, in what Claſs of <hi>Religions,</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> that <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> is to be repos'd, that on ſuch Terms calls it ſelf <hi>Catholick,</hi> by laying them into the <hi>Prophetical</hi> Scales, then by the most conſiderable <hi>Moments</hi> of Diſcourſe without <hi>Prophecy.</hi> I know better, when a <hi>Church-Supremacy</hi> entred, by the <hi>Prophetical Era</hi> joyn'd with that (however it may be by any controverted) Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> that <hi>Phocas</hi> gave it <hi>Anno</hi> 606, then I can know by ſome very learned Tracts concerning it. I better understand of what ſmall avail that Diſtinction betwixt the <hi>Court</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Vogue with ſome great Names can be, by offering it to the <hi>Prophetical Teſt,</hi> then by any other way of Exploration; although I look upon the Diſtinction, as a Confeſſion extorted by Divine Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon both, from <hi>Prophets of their own,</hi> that that <hi>Court</hi> is the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and that he ought to have ſuch a <hi>Court</hi> that the <hi>Prophecy</hi> might be <hi>fulfill'd;</hi> And what a <hi>Church</hi> it is, I learn from the <hi>Prophetical Syſtem</hi> of the <hi>Churches,</hi> of which I have given a brief ſurvey, though it does not ſo expreſly concern Time, yet as moſt admirably illuſtrating, as well as concurring with other <hi>Prophetical Iconiſms,</hi> and <hi>Characters of Time.</hi> And to every part I have added Brief Remarques, directing to that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience of the Saints,</hi> to <hi>that keeping the Commands of God, and the Teſtimony of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> which are the uſe of all the Diſcourſe that at that <hi>Glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> It may be ſaid of us; Here are they that have ſo done. <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 12.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:41903:4"/>
            <p> Thus I have given Account of what is now drawn in full, and whole, and what only in little, in ſhort <hi>Calendary</hi> Proportions, which I intend, <hi>if God pleaſe,</hi> to give in more proper <hi>Dimenſions,</hi> as alſo to make compleat concerning the <hi>Churches,</hi> concerning the <hi>Voices,</hi> and <hi>Vials,</hi> concerning the <hi>thouſand years,</hi> what is rather in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective,</hi> then in <hi>juſt Figures</hi> of Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I have only to add, that notwithſtanding, ſpeaking, or writing the <hi>Word of God,</hi> I muſt <hi>obey the heavenly Viſions</hi> throughout, yet as that teaches me, I yield all the Regards, Deferences of Honour, and eſteem due to the Character, Learning, Vertue, general Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, that I can render to every Perſon, and much more to <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>all in Authority,</hi> however of a <hi>Communion,</hi> I could for this <hi>Propheſies ſake</hi> moſt earneſtly pray, and even offer my Life in the Service, they might not be of.</p>
            <p>But nothing can be more effectual againſt Rebellion, Sedition, or any Irregularity towards <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>ſupream Power,</hi> then the Right <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of this <hi>Prophecy.</hi> For while Holy <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> ſtyles them <hi>Kings,</hi> who yet <hi>give their Kingdoms to the Beaſt,</hi> the plain <hi>Doctrinal,</hi> and <hi>Preceptive</hi> part of <hi>Scripture,</hi> obliges, as to <hi>fear God,</hi> ſo to <hi>Honour</hi> thoſe, whom It ſo ſtyles <hi>Kings,</hi> and then <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Supplications, Interceſſions, giving of Thanks</hi> ſhould <hi>be made for them, and for all in Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it poſſible any Pretence of ſetting up or advancing <hi>Chriſts Kingdom</hi> can juſtifie any Rebellions, mutinous or ſeditious Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſeeing hitherto, It is most evident, they have proceeded upon mistakes of Time, And when ever that <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſhall <hi>Appear,</hi> The manner of Appearance is miſtaken alſo, for it is not as from <hi>Earth,</hi> but as from <hi>Heaven,</hi> Heavenly, Spiritual, Pure, Peaceable, yet Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Almighty; Regular, Orderly, conducted by lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, even thoſe, who till <hi>the Words of God are fulfill'd,</hi> have <hi>ſo given their Power,</hi> ſo that as well may the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Day of Judgment,</hi> which no created Power can produce, or oppoſe, be made a pretence for Rebellion, as the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Prophecy</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or be complain'd as dangerous to <hi>Government,</hi> or deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to <hi>Humane Society.</hi>

                  <p>THE <hi>Viſion</hi> of the 2300 <hi>Evenings</hi> and <hi>Mornings,</hi> dates moſt exactly, and preciſely the Time from the very Beginning of the <hi>Perſian Monarchy</hi> or the <hi>First of Cyrus</hi> to the <hi>cleanſing of the Sanctuary,</hi> at the <hi>new Jeruſalem,</hi> and the <hi>breaking of Antichrist without hand,</hi> or by the <hi>ſtone cut out of the Mountains without hand,</hi> at the Kingdom of Chriſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 14. 25.</p>
                  <p>The order of the former <hi>Viſions,</hi> duely conſider'd, gives great light to this.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, there is in the courſe of <hi>Ezekiels Viſions</hi> a long allotment of Time, till the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> and a peculiar Sanction of the <hi>prophetical</hi> Cypher of Time, or of a <hi>Day</hi> for a <hi>Year, Ezek.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41903:7"/>
                  <p> That gives full ſcope aed room to thoſe <hi>Monarchies</hi> to run their Time, as in the Image, and the <hi>four Beaſts in Daniel's</hi> two precedent <hi>Viſions.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 2. c. 7.</p>
                  <p>The former of thoſe two, or the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Image,</hi> gives only a general Appearance of ſo many <hi>Monarchies</hi> or <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> or rather of a <hi>Monarchy</hi> univerſal, ſhifting from one People and their Kingdom to another, and all adverſe to the Kingdom of Chriſt; for that could not appear while they were in Play.</p>
                  <p>From hence ariſes ſuch a Line of Time; as neceſſarily is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd for <hi>four Monarchies</hi> to diſplay themſelves; but becauſe they may be ſhorter or longer in their duration, they give no certain meaſures; only, as that there is no <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of Action elder than <hi>Moſes</hi>'s of the Creation, appearing in the World; it is an Argument of weight againſt the World's Eternity: ſo on the other ſide, the daily matter of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> ariſing from many other Kings and Kingdoms, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the <hi>Romans,</hi> aſſure us, the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> is not yet come; becauſe while that laſts, the grand foretold <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt</hi> cannot come.</p>
                  <p>But now the next <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Four Beaſts,</hi> gives us in <hi>Prophetick</hi> Cypher the very meaſure of the <hi>Beast</hi>'s Duration, as that <hi>Beaſt</hi> is ſymboll'd by the <hi>little Horn,</hi> viz. <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>half a Time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe this does not aſſure us when thoſe Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, nor conſequently, where they end, the <hi>Viſion</hi> we are now entring upon will teach us that.</p>
                  <p>And it hath a threefold Aſpect upon Time to this end.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It continues the principal Line of Time from Creation, which, becauſe there will not be <hi>Scripture Hiſtory</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, and alſo becauſe, and eſpecially becauſe, the Times of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (in whoſe <hi>Hiſtory</hi> Scripture little concerns it ſelf,) are drawn by it without leſſer Periods, but as the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the Churches Caſe in relation to them after requires it; they are given in one entire Line or Sum, 2300 <hi>Days,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning contiguouſly from <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s 430 Days, and continuouſly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41903:7"/> alſo to ſo many Days for Years uniting with the former par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel-lines, and with the 430, as the laſt given Line; and ſo one whole Line from the Creation is conſtituted by uniting theſe ſeveral Parcels, by a divine Certainty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It determines the particular Time from the beginning of the <hi>Perſian Monarchy,</hi> at <hi>literal Babylon</hi> fallen, to <hi>myſtical Babylon</hi> falling, as alſo at <hi>literal Jeruſalem</hi> reſtor'd, to <hi>new Jeruſalem</hi> appearing; for <hi>Antichriſt broken</hi> intends the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the <hi>Sanctuary cleans'd the latter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a meaſure of the length of particular Lines given after this from Time to Time, as they are given in Scripture, that, as it ſelf is diſtinguiſh'd into ſeveral Periods by them, ſo it is a Boundary to them, when to begin and end; that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether they may be <hi>ſymmetral</hi> to this whole Line, neither longer, nor ſhorter, and therein be juſtly proportion'd to one another; even till this Line, call'd moſt emphatically by our Lord, the <hi>Times of the Gentiles,</hi> Luc. 21. 24. be <hi>fulfill'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Viſion</hi> then, and the Line of Time it carries away, be rightly underſtood, theſe things are neceſſary to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the principal thing in theſe <hi>Viſions</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that ſingle <hi>Viſion</hi> next in order to that we are upon, that centers in <hi>Meſſiah's Coming</hi> and <hi>Death,)</hi> is the glorious <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of his <hi>Saints,</hi> having the <hi>Dominion</hi> throughout the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the Deſtruction of that peculiar Enemy of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> who is juſtly call'd <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preceeding his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and before which it could not <hi>appear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the Account of this <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> having its way made by the Deſtruction of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Repreſentations of the other <hi>Monarchies,</hi> of which elſe we may conceive, the Holy Spirit had no more touch'd their <hi>Prophecy,</hi> than it does their <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> which it never does, but in relation to the <hi>Church,</hi> or to ſet out God's Government Univerſal over the World, and his Judgment on ſinful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41903:8"/>
                  <p> We find therefore in theſe <hi>Viſions</hi> of the <hi>Monarchies, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> next to the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> is the greateſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and more Words laid out upon him, than upon all the reſt: ſo it is in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's Dream,</hi> The <hi>Feet</hi> and <hi>Toes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 2. v. 34. 41. &amp;c.</note> take up a greater Proportion of the <hi>Dream</hi> and <hi>Expoſition,</hi> than all the reſt; and then the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> flows out upon the <hi>Image broken</hi> in the <hi>Feet.</hi> So in the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>four Beaſts,</hi> the <hi>fourth Beaſt,</hi> and in that the <hi>little Horn</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys the greateſt part of the whole <hi>Viſion</hi> in its Deſcription and Judgment: and the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> then breaks out upon it; ſo proportionably in this <hi>Viſion:</hi> He then that would underſtand it, muſt be arm'd with this Rule, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It muſt be worthy our Advertency, that the <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian State</hi> in theſe <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is rank'd with <hi>Heatheniſm</hi> and <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> and treated with much leſs regard than even <hi>Idolatrous Iſrael,</hi> or <hi>Judah;</hi> God not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any notice of them, as his People, but as mere <hi>Gentiles:</hi> ſo that I do not remember any Paralleliſm of them with the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even in their <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> but altogether with thoſe that were Aliens, as <hi>Balaam, Jezebel,</hi> the <hi>Daughter</hi> of <hi>Elth Baal King of the Sydonians;</hi> with <hi>Sodom, Egypt,</hi> and moſt notoriouſly <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſo is repreſented by the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles treading the outward Court.</hi> And thus the Corruptions of Divine Worſhip among the <hi>Jews</hi> were expreſs'd by enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the <hi>manners</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles, defiling</hi> themſelves with them, <hi>falling in love</hi> with them, <hi>bringing</hi> them into the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.</hi> The <hi>Beaſt</hi> united with the <hi>heathen idolatrous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> coming into the <hi>Seat of the Dragon,</hi> is the grand <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Figure for Antichriſt, and nothing of Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him, except to the other <hi>Beaſt having borns,</hi> as a <hi>Lamb,</hi> while <hi>he ſpake as a Dragon,</hi> nor of the <hi>Jews</hi> to the <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>

                     <hi>of Antichriſt,</hi> except one only alluſion to the <hi>City,</hi> where <hi>Our Lord was crucified</hi> (where a <hi>Heathen</hi> Power preſided in <note place="margin">Revel. 11. 8.</note> his Condemnation, and that a <hi>Roman</hi> too) to ſignifie its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Hate to the True Chriſt.

                  <p>On the other ſide, The <hi>True Chriſtianity</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> of it are ſymboliz'd by the pure <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Worſhip; The <hi>Temple,</hi> its <hi>Meaſures, Ordinances,</hi> as they ſtood in <hi>Iſraels</hi> beſt Eſtate, are the <hi>Ichnography</hi> of the Perfect, Pure, <hi>Chriſtian Church;</hi> But the drawing men from <hi>True Chriſtianity,</hi> to <hi>Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm;</hi> the Perſecution of Men for it, the laſt Deliverance from <hi>Anti-Christianiſm,</hi> and its Perſecutions are continually given out in Parallelliſmes, betwixt the ſame Things hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore between the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and unite with the <hi>Jews</hi> great Deliverance, and the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> at laſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two things are moſt neceſſary to be premoniſh'd, for the true Interpretation of this <hi>Viſion,</hi> and other <hi>Viſions alſo, as</hi> we ſhall ſee, as we paſs along, to preſerve all clear and free from Confuſion.</p>
                  <p>And upon this Premonition, I ſay, this <hi>Viſion</hi> beginning with the <hi>Perſian Reign,</hi> goes on through the <hi>Grecian,</hi> and ſo paſſes through the whole <hi>Roman Monarchy,</hi> firſt and laſt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes a Line running parallel with the whole <hi>Times of the Gentiles,</hi> after the <hi>Babyloniſh Empire,</hi> at the end of which, <hi>Ezekiels</hi> 430 <hi>Days</hi> ended, as hath been made to appear. And they being the laſt Joynt of the Line from Creation, this Line of 230 Days joyns with it, and continues the whole <note place="margin">Acts. 3. 21.</note> Line from <hi>Creation</hi> to the <hi>Reſtitution of all Things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this Premonition I ſay further, That <hi>Antiochus,</hi> as the moſt Infamous <hi>Heathen</hi> Prince for <hi>treading down the holy</hi> and pure <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Worſhip, from the Days of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> while that Worſhip remain'd to be Gods Worſhip; from which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41903:9"/> impure Peſſundation, that Holy Worſhip was moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vindicated; and the Time of his Tyranny being in the moſt intimate part of it in literal or natural Account, near the Time of <hi>Antichriſts</hi> 1260. Days, at a <hi>day for a year,</hi> and near the whole 2300 in the whole of it, and being <hi>broken</hi> by an <hi>immediate Hand from Heaven,</hi> without an <hi>earthly Hand,</hi> as <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall be; He is made a moſt notable and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Type of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and ſo with Relation to Him, and his Time, a Line is drawn from <hi>Cyrus</hi> to the <hi>cleanſing of the Sanstuary,</hi> polluted by <hi>Antichristian Gentiles,</hi> and to the <hi>breaking of Antichriſt without Hand; Antiochus</hi> ſtanding all this while in open view, as a Type, and his Time, as a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Line of Time.</p>
                  <p>And yet while his Time will ſerve a Typical End, It is not exact enough to either main Intention, to be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Thing to be meaſured by that Line of Time.</p>
                  <p>And for the making good theſe Aſſertions, I ſhall now apply my ſelf to the ſolemn Proof of theſe two Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the 2300 <hi>Days</hi> are a definitive Line of Time, from the beginning of the <hi>Perſian Monarchy,</hi> to the very End of the <hi>Monarchies,</hi> and till the <hi>Supream Monarchy of Chriſt;</hi> and ſo are to be joyn'd to the end of the laſt Line, and thereby to the ſeveral Lines from the Creation; that altogether may reach that End.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Viſion principally intends <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in every Part, wherein <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſtands, as a Type.</p>
                  <p>For the Proof of the firſt Aſſertion I uſe this firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>1</label>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a plain Concatenation or Connexion of this <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with the former, as following orderly upon or after it; For that purpoſe and to make it known it is ſo, <hi>Daniel</hi> tells us, This Viſion appear'd unto him, after that, which appear'd <note place="margin">c. 8. v. 1.</note> unto him at the firſt; Now that this was not intended, as any Date of the <hi>Viſion,</hi> is very plain, in that It is more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly dated by aſſigning it to the <hi>third Year</hi> of <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> whereas the firſt was aſſign'd to the firſt year of the ſame
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41903:9"/> 
                     <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> and ſo muſt needs be after the firſt <hi>Viſion,</hi> even as <hi>Belſhazzars Third</hi> Year muſt be after his <hi>Firſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words therefore cannot, but be of further Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſignifie to us; This <hi>Viſion</hi> comes after the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in a juſt Order, and promotes the ſcope of it, and adds further Light to it; Now it is moſt evident, the <hi>four Beaſts</hi> intending <hi>four Kingdoms,</hi> and <hi>Antichrist,</hi> the <hi>little Horn</hi> with his <hi>Time, Times,</hi> and <hi>half a Time,</hi> and then his being <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> ſucceeding, are the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Objects of that <hi>Viſion,</hi> and therefore they muſt be ſo of This. And in ſome notable Inſtance thereof, It muſt exceed the Notices of the former, and what can that be but in the Notices of Time? Wherein it is ſo particular as to 2300 <hi>Evenings, Mornings,</hi> for to ſhew it one Line of Time, It is in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> 2300 <hi>Evening Morning,</hi> not 2300 <hi>Evenings Mornings,</hi> although for Arguments ſake with Ordinary Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and in Agreement with the ſence we may expreſs them in the plural Number, and it is alſo call'd the <hi>Viſion of the Evening Morning,</hi> as ſo many <hi>Evenings</hi> and <hi>Mornings</hi> combin'd into one, from the <hi>Monarchy of Cyrus,</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> to the <hi>Monarchy of Christs <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Viſion begins at the <hi>Perſian Monarchy,</hi> goes on <note place="margin">
                        <hi>General Argu.</hi> 2.</note> through the <hi>Grecian Monarchy,</hi> and ſo to the End; and the Line of Time runs parallel with the <hi>Viſion,</hi> therefore the Line of 2300 <hi>Evenings Mornings</hi> muſt reach from the Beginning of the <hi>Perſian Monarchy</hi> to the <hi>Monarchy of Chriſt,</hi> which is the known and moſt undoubted End of the <hi>Four Monarchies,</hi> and of all <hi>Monarchy,</hi> but under him.</p>
                  <p>This Argument conſiſts of theſe three main Propoſitions.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Babylonian Monarchy</hi> was yet ſtanding, the <hi>Prophet</hi> a Subject of it in principal Place; for he continued in his Preferment in <hi>Babylon</hi> till <hi>Cyrus the Perſian.</hi> He muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Dan. 1. 21.</note> be reſident at the time of the Viſion in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and not a Runnagate from it, and his Loyalty; but was <hi>prophetically</hi> and <hi>viſionally</hi> ſet down at the Pallace of <hi>Perſia,</hi> to ſhew where the <hi>Viſions</hi> Date was to commence, <hi>viz.</hi> from the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Monarchy.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Monarchy</hi> was now indeed juſt expiring in <hi>Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar's Third,</hi> which Scripture counts upon as his laſt Year, and whereas the former <hi>Viſions</hi> were deliver'd to us in the Language of that <hi>Empire;</hi> that thereby <hi>All People, Tongues,</hi> and <hi>Languages,</hi> which take care by one means or other to have knowledge of the <hi>Imperial Language,</hi> might have notice of them.

                  <p> But the <hi>Monarchy</hi> was not yet fully expir'd, nor was the <hi>Image</hi> in all ſucceeding Ages to be bereft of its <hi>Head;</hi> while therefore the <hi>Image,</hi> and the <hi>Iconiſm</hi> of the <hi>four Beasts,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating the <hi>Image</hi> ſtood in the Eye of <hi>Prophecy; Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer</hi> is the principal in the <hi>first Monarchy,</hi> with the <hi>Heart of</hi> a <hi>Man,</hi> after his <hi>Eagles Wings</hi> were <hi>pluck'd,</hi> importing his ſober Acknowledgments of God, upon the Humiliation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which his <hi>Frenzy</hi> dejected him, even into a ſtate among the <hi>Beaſts,</hi> but he ſeems to have riſen out of <hi>Beſtianiſm</hi> it ſelf by abaſing himſelf before God. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi>

                  <p>The principal Reaſon therefore of omitting the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Monarchy,</hi> is, becauſe, The <hi>Prophetical Type</hi> of the <hi>four Monarchies,</hi> being fully ſatisfied, and repleniſhed, The great attendance of the Divine Spirit is to the Line of Time, which it joyns to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Lines, that went before, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to <hi>Ezekiels</hi> 430 <hi>Days,</hi> or <hi>Years,</hi> which juſt comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ended with the <hi>Babyloniſh Monarchy,</hi> which <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> in a <hi>real Calendar</hi> I have before, more than once ſaid, began the <hi>Gentiles Times,</hi> during which <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> lay, and was to lye under <hi>Foot;</hi> but juſt here the <hi>Babyloniſh Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> is no farther given in <hi>Type,</hi> although it remains in the former Types, to the laſt; but the Future Line of Time is given in 2300 Evenings Mornings from the <hi>Perſian Monarchy,</hi> beginning; And this latter could not have been given with <hi>Prophetick</hi> Secrecy, and yet alſo without Confuſion, if the former had not been omitted, whoſe Time given before could not enter into this, but it muſt confound Time every way.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41903:11"/>
                  <p> But thus this principal Line reaches from <hi>Literal Babylon fallen to myſtical Babylon fallen,</hi> from <hi>Literal Jeruſalem</hi> near to be rebuilt with its <hi>Temple,</hi> to the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> which much adorns this Line of Time, and ſets theſe two juſt even from Point to Point.</p>
                  <p>It is true, The <hi>Four,</hi> as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Monarchies,</hi> are together the great <hi>Canale</hi> of Time, till the <hi>glorious Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> whatever great States or Kingdoms were coexiſtent with them or any of them at any Time, or have ariſen ſince, do not mingle with this Stream, which runs ſtrait on to this end, nor are any of themſelves adopted into it ſooner than the juſt Time of their Succeſſion into <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Monarchy;</hi> nor do they abide any longer in it, as a <hi>Calendar</hi> of Time, after once they are fallen from that <hi>

                  <p>And becauſe of this real ſubſtantial <hi>Calendar</hi> of Time in theſe <hi>Monarchies,</hi> the firſt Act of <hi>Chriſt's Kingdom</hi> is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> to be the <hi>putting down all Rule, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>

                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:41903:11"/>
                  <p> That therefore which is moſt conſiderable in the Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this Courſe of Time farther to us, is, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Gentiles Times, viz.</hi> this ſubſtantial <hi>Calendar</hi> of the <hi>four Monarchies,</hi> began in the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> ſo long as that <hi>Calendar</hi> is in preſenting, the <hi>Babylonian</hi> is never omitted, but is the <hi>Capital</hi> in it; but when it comes to this <hi>Numeral</hi> Line, or the 2300 <hi>Ev. Mor.</hi> it is then omitted, becauſe the <hi>Numeral Line</hi> runs not upon any Revolutions of theſe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies,</hi> but upon ſome eminent Providence of God towards his <hi>Church,</hi> either of Mercy towards it, or its ſuffering under the Tyranny of ſome of theſe <hi>Monarchies,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian;</hi> as will be ſeen all along; which is a very clear Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the <hi>Babylonian</hi> is firſt ſo chief in the <hi>Calendar</hi> of the <hi>Monarchies;</hi> for that being one, and the firſt, it muſt be ſo in the Real: But when it comes to the Numeral, it is of no uſe, becauſe it had been given in the laſt numeral Line, as then exiſting; it is not given in the following Numeral, becauſe it was then paſt, and would diſorder the Account. The <hi>real Calendar</hi> is taken from each <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Monarchy</hi> that had the <hi>Jews,</hi> particularly the <hi>Tribe of Judah,</hi> in Subjection, and ſo oppreſs'd Chriſt's Kingdom; here the <hi>Babylonian</hi> was the <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> the <hi>ſecond,</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> the <hi>third,</hi> the <hi>fourth</hi> the <hi>Roman:</hi> under which, as <hi>Imperial,</hi> firſt, the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>deſolated;</hi> The <hi>manly Birth,</hi> or <hi>Christ, as King,</hi> was <hi>watch'd,</hi> as by a <hi>Dragon;</hi> Chriſtians lay, as <hi>martyr'd</hi> under the <hi>Altar,</hi> and then under it, as <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> lies ſubdued the <hi>ſpiritual Iſrael,</hi> till both That, and the <hi>Twelve Tribes,</hi> are reſtor'd by <hi>Chriſt's Kingdom.</hi> So theſe are the <hi>Times of the Gentiles,</hi> before which neither the <hi>twelve Tribes,</hi> nor the <hi>Apoſtolical Church</hi> are fully reſtor'd, or can be.</p>
                  <p>From all which, it is moſt evident, that though the <hi>Viſion</hi> is not dated from the <hi>Perſian Monarchy,</hi> as if it was given for the <hi>Perſian Monarchy's</hi> ſake; yet the 2300 Ev. Morn. begin juſt when that begins, and very fitly, becauſe the <hi>Perſian Cyrus</hi> found the <hi>Temple fallen,</hi> and the daily <hi>Service of the Jews taken away,</hi> and proclaims the Reſtoration, which makes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41903:12"/> the Date, as we ſhall ſee. And this is the firſt thing that was to be prov'd.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Propoſition follows; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>twenty</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Of this we have many Arguments in the <hi>Viſion it ſelf,</hi> which having briefly directed firſt unto, I will endeavour by far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrong Proof from the whole courſe of <hi>Prophecy</hi> to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it.</p>

                  <p>And what <hi>last end of the Indignation</hi> can be meant, but that of the Deſolation determin'd on the <hi>Jews</hi> in the very next <hi>Viſion,</hi> that explains it together with <hi>Ezekiel's bearing their Iniquity,</hi> till the <hi>New Jeruſalem?</hi>

                  <p>Now when ſuch a Queſtion is ask'd, and the Anſwer is given, <hi>to ſo long,</hi> the moſt natural ſenſe is, When no Time is fix'd for the Beginning, that the preſent Time ſhould be underſtood to be it; and when it is added, <hi>And then ſhall the Sanctuary be cleans'd,</hi> it is plain, a <hi>cleanſing of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> proportionable to the <hi>treading it under foot,</hi> muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Viſion,</hi> and of its 2300 Days.

The ſeveral parts of the <hi>Viſion</hi> have indeed ſeveral ſpaces of Time cut out of the whole ſpace, proper to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But as the <hi>Viſion</hi> is one entire <hi>Viſion,</hi> ſo the <hi>Date</hi> is one entire <hi>Date,</hi> and can be no other to agree with the whole <hi>Viſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Viſion</hi> is call'd ten times, The <hi>Viſion,</hi> to ſhew it is all one and the ſame Viſion, and the ſeveral parts of it are but as the parts of one and the ſame Body, Lines of the ſame Image.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Expoſition</hi> of the <hi>Viſion</hi> anſwers part for part to the <hi>Viſion</hi> it ſelf, firſt given; ſaving, that in the <hi>Viſion Antiochus</hi> the <hi>Type</hi> appears uppermoſt, but in the Expoſition the <hi>Anti-type</hi> appears uppermoſt, and, as in Reaſon it ſhould be, is moſt apparent: and the whole <hi>Viſion</hi> being expounded, is call'd, The <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Even.</hi> and <hi>Morn.</hi> all the 2300 being united into one, as it were to unite the whole <hi>Viſion,</hi> and the whole Line of Time, as cloſe and entire as poſſibly may be.</p>
                  <p>And which is moſt remarkable, Before the <hi>Expoſition</hi> of the <hi>Viſion,</hi> the ſpace of Time allowed to the whole <hi>Viſion,</hi> of which the <hi>Taking away, &amp;c.</hi> was the chief (as in the <hi>Anti-type</hi> however couched under the <hi>Type)</hi> is given before the <hi>Expoſition,</hi> or juſt between the <hi>Viſion</hi> and the <hi>Expoſition,</hi> that it might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute it ſelf to the whole of both; and in the <hi>Expoſition,</hi> it is therefore ſo ſumm'd up, that it cannot be divided, but muſt remain entire to the whole; for it is, as was ſaid, but <hi>one Ev.</hi> and one <hi>Mor.</hi> applied to all the <hi>Viſion;</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we ſhall find the <hi>Dividend,</hi> or <hi>Allotment</hi> to each part, and moſt particularly to the <hi>Daily taken away;</hi> to each, I ſay, their part, of the 2300 <hi>Ev.

                  </p>
                  <p>And leſt any one ſhould inſiſt too hard on the <hi>Daily,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it of the <hi>Jewiſh daily Sacrifice;</hi> beſides, that any Word importing <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is preſcinded, and only <hi>Tammith,</hi>

                  <p>So then if the Line be commenſurate with the <hi>Viſion,</hi> it muſt begin with the <hi>Perſian Monarchy,</hi> and not with the <hi>daily taken away,</hi> for That, in whatever ſenſe expounded, was not till long after: in the ſame manner, If the <hi>Viſion</hi> goes on to the great <hi>viſional End</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> viz. the <hi>breaking of all the Monarchies in Antichrist,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of Christ appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Sanctuary cleans'd,</hi> it cannot be applied to any <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> that was begun, and <hi>ended</hi> long before that <hi>End,</hi> as all <hi>takings</hi> away, of what kind ſoever, that have been thought of, did, (and moſt particularly that of <hi>Antiochus)</hi> except that <hi>taking away</hi> by <hi>Antichrist;</hi> which therefore is the only <hi>taking away</hi> here to be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>And from every Particular of this Diſcourſe it undeniably appears, Theſe <hi>Ev.</hi> and <hi>Mor.</hi> are not mere <hi>Natural Nycthemers,</hi> but 2300 <hi>Ev.</hi> and <hi>Mor.</hi> importing ſo many Years; for a leſs ſpace of Time could not contain ſo great a <hi>Viſion</hi> and its <hi>Charge.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. The very drawing it out to ſo great and unuſual a length, is unparallel'd in all the Scripture; ſo that if it were not great in its Beginning, as that State of Things would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, great in the End, as that State of Things imports, and great in its ſubordinate Lines, it could no ways anſwer the Magnificence of ſo great a Number, eſpecially when the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Even this does ſufficiently argue, where it begins, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it tends, what ſpace of Time it ſpans: Cypher or ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand was of Old in <hi>prophetick</hi> uſe; a Week for ſeven Years, <note place="margin">Gen. 29. 27. c. 41. v. 26.

But God declar'd, and promulg'd it as the Law of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>prophetick</hi> Time, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. So we underſtand <hi>ſeventy Weeks, Weeks</hi> of <hi>Years</hi> without controul, or 490 Years, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. Now if contrary to ſo many Inſtances of the <hi>propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Uſage of ſuch Abbreviatures, it ſhould draw out Years into their full Length, or Number of Days, How could we underſtand the Divine Mind in it, eſpecially on no greater occaſion than <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s Tyranny, as ſhall be after argued? <hi>Prophecy,</hi> that amaſſes Time by giving <hi>Years</hi> in Days, cannot rationally be ſuppos'd to wiredraw Years into <hi>Days.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is not All: There are <hi>fourty Days</hi> for <hi>fourty Years,</hi> 390 and 40 <hi>Days</hi> for ſo many <hi>Years; ſeventy Weeks</hi> for 490 <hi>Years;</hi> 1260 <hi>Days</hi> for ſo many <hi>Years,</hi> and <hi>Months</hi> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable: But 2300 <hi>Ev.

                  <p>Every Scripture Line of Time argues this ſo great a Line <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>1</label> from <hi>Adam</hi> to the <hi>Flood,</hi> from the <hi>Flood</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi> to the <hi>Redemption out of Egypt,</hi> from thence to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> and ſo to his <hi>Death,</hi> are indiſputable; and general Senſe of Interpreters carries the 390 <hi>Days</hi> or <hi>Years</hi> as far as the <hi>Temple burnt.</hi> After the <hi>Captivity,</hi> few, if any, Chriſtian Interpreters, doubt of the <hi>ſeventy Weeks,</hi> as 490 <hi>Years,</hi> reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Now if theſe Lines are not continued, fill'd up throughout the whole ſpace of Time, even as a <hi>Vacuum</hi> is in Nature, ſo would ſuch an empty ſpace be in Time; it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41903:16"/> turns all to Confuſion, we ſee how hard it is to fix the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or end of any Line, for want of acknowledged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Lines; as we find by Experience, how few agree in either the Beginning or Period of the <hi>Weeks</hi> while they uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally agree in the definiteneſs of the Line. Let then <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiels</hi> 430 days reach to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as I have endeavoured to prove, and how juſtly will theſe 2300 days joyn them which were prepar'd as a medium betwixt <hi>Historical</hi> and <hi>Prophetical Time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And why ſhould we think, God, who hath taken Care for ſome parts of Time, hath not taken Care of all? Seeing the Proviſion elſe is maim'd, and unequal; or why for <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Time, and not for <hi>Prophetick?</hi> Seeing <hi>Prophecy</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory</hi> are alike preſent to him; and to us <hi>Prophecy</hi> is the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and requires that aſſurance moſt: Why for the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and not for that under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> when <hi>Revelational</hi> is higher, and more perfect.</p>
                  <p>It is a vain ſubterfuge, That, when the Times of theſe <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Monarchies</hi> came in, God truſted the Records of Time with them, which he did not truſt with his own People, without a ſupream Hand of <hi>Revelation,</hi> fixing ſuch Lines of Time, as were moſt exact, either before by <hi>Prophecy,</hi> or after by <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> as we ſee.</p>
                  <p>Now if this Argument have ſtrength in it, where can we find ſuch a Line, as this, ſo aggrandiz'd, ſo extended from its Epoch to the laſt end of all?</p>
                  <p>We ſhall find <hi>this long Line of Time,</hi> diſtributed into its <label type="milestone">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Daniel</hi> in the very next <hi>Viſion</hi> gives us the firſt, in the Time, or ſpace of the <hi>words going forth,</hi> and from thence <hi>ſeventy weeks.</hi> Then follows the <hi>ſealed Time,</hi> which by the <hi>revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Prophecy,</hi> we knew certainly laying it to <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> to be 400 years. Then follow immediately the <hi>thirteen hundred thirty five; twelve hundred ſixty</hi> of which are given, as we ſhall ſee in a ninefold variety, and yet conſent.</p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:41903:16"/>
                  <p> Now thoſe two, <hi>four hundred Ninety</hi> of the 70 <hi>Weeks,</hi> and <hi>thirteen hundred thirty five,</hi> can allow ſpace but for 475 more. Having then ſo good ground to <hi>fix four hundred</hi> between the <hi>Weeks,</hi> and the 1335, we may find in the <hi>Time of the Words going forth</hi> ſpace for the <hi>ſeventy five,</hi> but for no more. All which I propoſe rationally to make out.</p>
                  <p>So then we have this great Proof of the 2300 <hi>Evenings Mornings,</hi> as 2300 years, That we find them in the direct ſtream of <hi>Scripture Prophecy,</hi> and the Conſpiration of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> hitherto, which is more ſatisfactory then <hi>History</hi> giving us a courſe of Time, and its Events, one anſwering the other, for here <hi>History</hi> and <hi>Prophecy</hi> meet, as we ſhall ſee.</p>

                     <hi>In which a Line of</hi> Seventy Five Years, <hi>precedent to the ſeventy Weeks, is aſſerted, and endeavour'd to be prov'd.</hi> Dan. 9.</head>
                  <p>HAving in the precedent Sections eſtabliſh'd the <hi>Grand Line</hi> of 2300 <hi>Ev. Mor.</hi> and their Determination to the <hi>Kingdom of Christ;</hi> I now proceed to the Diſtribution of this Line, and firſt to the Line that muſt, however ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and collateral, yet ſet out at the very ſame inſtant with the 2300 Ev. Mor. and that is, <hi>of the Word going forth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now of this, It is moſt evident by Scripture, that it muſt begin at the <hi>Perſian Monarchy,</hi> or the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> for at <hi>Darius,</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> to whom Scripture allows only one <note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note> Year, it did not begin; for in that Year <hi>Daniel prayed,</hi> and had this Viſion in Return of Prayer, as appears enough throughout this Chap. At <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s <hi>first year</hi> it did begin; for ſo <hi>Ezra</hi> aſſures us, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. For muſt not that moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be the <hi>going forth of the Word,</hi> when <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſent forth his <hi>Proclamation,</hi> and put it in <hi>Writing, v.</hi> 1, 2. &amp;c?</p>
                  <p>But although the <hi>Word</hi> began here to go forth, yet it is moſt manifeſt, It did not here attain its effect; for then would it not have reſted, and ceaſed to <hi>go forth</hi> any farther? But we find it ſtop'd after the <hi>Altar</hi> ſet up, and the <hi>Foundations laid</hi> all the Reign of <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> and in the Days of <hi>Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes;</hi> which two, as we ſhall after reaſon, muſt be <hi>Cambyſes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ezra c. 4. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>the Son of Cyrus,</hi> and the Counterfeit <hi>Smerdis:</hi> ſo that it as plainly <hi>went forth</hi> again in the Reign of <hi>Darius,</hi> known in common <hi>Hiſtory</hi> by the Name of <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpis.</hi> After that, although it came much nearer its Perfection, yet it was contradicted in the Days of <hi>Xerxes Ahaſuerus,</hi> by ſo ſevere a Decree for the Deſtruction of the <hi>Jews,</hi> throughout all the <hi>Provinces;</hi> ſo that <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> call'd by Hiſtorians <hi>Longima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eſth. 3. 8.</note> illuſtrated his <hi>ſeventh Year</hi> with the <hi>Word</hi> compleatly <hi>going forth;</hi> The Eccho of which for the <hi>building of the Wall,</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:41903:18"/> was in his <hi>twentieth,</hi> and in his <hi>thirty ſecond</hi> the Quavers of that ſame <hi>Word,</hi> in leave to <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to <hi>reſtore Jeruſalem</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its perfect Order and Polity: which plainly argue the <hi>Word gone forth</hi> in his ſeventh Year.</p>
                  <p>Now although the great Perplexities of the <hi>Perſian Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology</hi> are no way to my main Intention to be concern'd in, yet the making it Evident, that the <hi>Going forth of the Word</hi> muſt take up ſuch a Time, as 75 Years, is of very deep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof in that Intention, both as it gives great Aſſurance to the former principal Line of 2300 <hi>Years;</hi> ſhewing how <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty five of them</hi> were ſpent, and alſo as it will inlighten ſome Concernments of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> to which all Accounts of Time tend. Upon this whole Conſideration I ſhall endeavour the proof of ſuch a ſpace implied in the <hi>word going forth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And firſt I ſhall obſerve that which I do not look upon ſo conſiderable as to call it an Argument. The very Phraſe of <hi>going forth</hi> implies ſome protracted and prolonged <hi>going</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mich. 5 2.</note> 
                     <hi>forth</hi> by the <hi>Word.</hi> The ſame Word is us'd of him, <hi>whoſe goings forth are from everlasting.</hi> But more enforcingly to preſs this, I thus argue.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible to ſpare any of thoſe great <hi>Decrees</hi> we have <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>1</label> ſo ſpecially recorded, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 7. from the <hi>words going forth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not the <hi>first,</hi> becauſe it was the <hi>first,</hi> ſo much foretold of formerly by the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> of ſo famous Memory, and that <hi>first</hi> broke the Bonds of the <hi>Jewiſh Captivity.</hi> Who can with poſſible Reaſon ſuppoſe, That had no Intereſt in the <hi>words going forth,</hi> in which <hi>Prophecy</hi> gloried ſo long before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that was even pointed upon by <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and from which the other Decrees were deriv'd, as is expreſly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd in <hi>Darius</hi>'s Decree, <hi>Ezra c.</hi> 6. compar'd with <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 21?</p>
                  <p>Nor can the <hi>ſecond Decree</hi> of <hi>Darius</hi> be denied a place in it, which ſo united it ſelf with <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s <hi>Decree,</hi> that if either was the <hi>word going forth,</hi> both muſt be ſo; for tho they were diſtant in Time, they were one in Subſtance, and by it the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> was built.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Ezra 7.</note> 
                     <hi>year,</hi> be impeached as to this Right; for it was the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive <hi>Decree,</hi> ſo liberal and ample, with ſuch Peculiarities in it all along, that there is not a word in the whole but yields an Argument: It excells all that went before, and leaves no Room for any to come after; It carries a great Senſe of God, revives all his <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Judgments;</hi> It gives the laſt Hand of <hi>Beauty,</hi> as <hi>Ezra</hi> expreſſes it, to <hi>beautifie the Houſe of Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ezr. 7. 25.</note> and all this by the <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>King, his ſeven Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,</hi> and <hi>Great Princes.</hi> Such a <hi>Decree,</hi> as there was none like it before it; nor after it any ſuch.

                  </p>
                  <p>The prefatory Deſcription of Chriſt hath ſeveral Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies of Preſence, like thoſe <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. and alſo <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. wherein the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> of Chriſt appears in his <hi>Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi> But in this they differ from the Majeſty of Chriſt, as on his Throne, wherein <hi>Ezekiel's Viſions</hi> exceed, and for the ſake of which He is ſo often honour'd with the Title, <hi>Son of Man,</hi> ſo peculiar to <hi>Christ's Kingdom,</hi> and wherein <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> came neareſt in the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Sanctuary cleans'd,</hi> and the Corrival to <hi>Christ's Princedome broken without hand,</hi> at the end of the 2300 <hi>Ev Morn.</hi> All which ſhall be then ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd in the State of the <hi>Jews</hi> reſtor'd, of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of Christ, Rev.</hi> 20. 4. and therefore there he is peculiarly call'd <hi>Son of Man,</hi> as before noted.</p>
                  <p>To ſhew it meaſures the ſame Time, as that of the <hi>Ev. Mor. Daniel,</hi> is much in the ſame manner affected: It begins in its very Date, near the Beginning of the <hi>Perſian Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy;</hi> it runs moſt evidently to the ſame <hi>End.</hi> And having now made theſe general Remarks upon it, I come to obſerve what is moſt particular in it, in the way of a ſhort <hi>Elenchus,</hi> or Table of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is peculiar to this <hi>Viſion,</hi> that tho Chriſt calls to mind in it His ſupreme Aſſiſtance to His, at the <hi>first Year</hi> of <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> who to diſtinguiſh him, is call'd <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> and of the <hi>Seed of the Medes,</hi> at the very Entrance of <hi>Cyrus's Perſian Monarchy;</hi> yet his <hi>third Year</hi> is the critical and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Date of it; for then that wonderful and unexpected ſtop upon ſo <hi>Royal a Decree</hi> by the divine Permiſſion was made, <note place="margin">Ezr. c. 3. compar'd with c. 4.</note> ſhewing the leiſurely Progreſſes of the <hi>divine Kingdom,</hi> and, as is moſt probably conceiv'd, <hi>Cyrus in his third Year</hi> making
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41903:25"/> foreign Expeditions, <hi>Cambyſes</hi> or <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his Son, was left <hi>Viceroy;</hi> upon whom <hi>the Enemies of the Jews</hi> gain'd ſo far, that though they could not plainly command a Ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet by Sleights and Artifices, They eluded the <hi>Decree,</hi> and <hi>fruſtrated the Work all the days of</hi> Cyrus.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Cyrus</hi> being <hi>dead</hi> in the <hi>days of the proper Reign of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi> or <hi>Cambyſes</hi> the <hi>Son of Cyrus,</hi> the <hi>Adverſaries</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> writ to him, and obtain'd his Edict againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Building. And in the Reign of <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> in the <hi>beginning of his Reign,</hi> wrote they alſo an <hi>Accuſation,</hi> and ſtill prevail'd.</p>
                  <p>Now by <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> I underſtand the <hi>Counterfeit Smerdis,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ezr. 4. v. 5, 6, 7.</note> whoſe Reign being very ſhort, it is ſaid, In the <hi>beginning of his Reign:</hi> And by <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> I underſtand <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> who reign'd indeed before <hi>Ahaſuerus:</hi> yet the <hi>Sacred Hiſtory</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a fuller Account of the whole matter, gives firſt the general Account, that <hi>all the days of Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Work</hi> was <hi>fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated;</hi> then takes in <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> firſt, becauſe his Reign was ſhort, and then gives the true <hi>Series</hi> of Things in <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> who was firſt in the days of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> poſſeſs'd againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſuffer'd an artificial Impedition of them. When he came to Reign, he laid a Prohibition on their <hi>Building.</hi> When <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> began to Reign, after the Death of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> upon that change, attempted to revive their Work, but on <hi>Letters</hi> to <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> by their Enemies, were ſtill <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.</hi> At the Reign of <hi>Darius</hi> being twice diſcouraged, they lay ſtill, till arous'd by <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechariah</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and confirm'd by <hi>Darius</hi> in a new Enterpriſe, they begin the Work again.</p>
                  <p>That which juſtifies this, as the True Order, is, That the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> expreſly tells us, upon the Letter to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> The <hi>work ceas'd,</hi> and that it <hi>ceas'd</hi> till the <hi>ſecond Year of Darius the Perſian,</hi> all the <hi>Days of Artaxerxes Cambyſes,</hi> all the ſhort <hi>Reign of Ahaſuerus,</hi> or the <hi>Counterfeit Smerdis;</hi> Under <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> then, it began to <hi>ceaſe;</hi> and till then the <hi>Ceſſation</hi> continued. And thus often, <hi>Sacred Story</hi> poſtpones that, on
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41903:25"/> which it intends to place the full and largeſt Accounts, and therein directs the true Order yet; As here, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> is poſtpond to <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> although before him.</p>
                  <p>And of this Delay of the <hi>Building,</hi> the Space otherwiſe unknown, is made known in this <hi>Viſion</hi> by the <hi>one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days</hi> Reſiſtance Chriſt found from the <hi>Angel-Prince</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Angel-Prince</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtood with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe <hi>twenty one days,</hi> viz. <hi>days for years;</hi> for what could <hi>twenty one days</hi> Reſiſtance ſignifie to ſuch a ſtop of the <hi>Building,</hi> if naturally taken? <hi>Daniel</hi> obſerv'd a <hi>ſymbolical Fast; three weeks of days, a day for a year,</hi> as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd on <hi>each ſide;</hi> ſo that it is true, <hi>The weeks of days</hi> do diſtinguiſh thoſe <hi>weeks of days</hi> from the <hi>ſeventy weeks of years,</hi> and yet they are a <hi>Type of twenty one days for years</hi> alſo: ſo that here we have an Explanation of ſo much Time as the ſtop of the <hi>Building</hi> amounted to, as ſo many years of the <hi>Perſian Time,</hi> as was before explain'd of the <hi>Word going forth,</hi> and it juſtifies that Account ſo far towards 75, where it is poſſibly moſt needed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here we have alſo the Intimation of the whole <hi>Hiſtory of Eſther,</hi> as pertaining to the <hi>Decree</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> Deſtruction and Deliverance, compris'd in the ſhort Note of Chriſt's ſpeedy diſpatch of this <hi>Viſion</hi> to <hi>Daniel,</hi> and returning to ſight for the Jews with the ſame <hi>Angel prince of Perſia,</hi> who, <note place="margin">Zec. 3. 1.</note> as <hi>Sathan, ſtood at their right-hand to reſist them,</hi> and this Reaſon to believe, That <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> was <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who was the <hi>fourth King,</hi> richer than all the former; <hi>viz.</hi> In compliance with that Character, The <hi>Hiſtory of Eſther</hi> thus deſcribes him, This is <hi>that Ahaſuerus</hi> that <hi>Reigned</hi> from <hi>India to Ethiopia:</hi>

                     <hi>Danger,</hi> (as Chriſt ſignifies by the <hi>King of Grecia coming</hi> when he return'd to <hi>fight with the Prince of Perſia</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Haman's Decree,)</hi> laid the Foundation of that War, <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander the Great, a Prince doing after his own Will,</hi> purſued ſo as to put an end to the <hi>Perſian Monarchy,</hi> and the <hi>Grecian</hi> ſucceeded.</p>
                  <p>And this I have treated the more largely, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms and farther clears what hath been ſaid of the <hi>Words go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth.</hi>

                  <p>And becauſe all this ſhould by the Will of Chriſt be yet drawn out more definitively, He is pleas'd to add, <hi>From the Time</hi> of the <hi>Daily,</hi> or <hi>Continual,</hi> in the very ſame only word <hi>Tammith,</hi> (no where applied alone to <hi>Sacrifice;)</hi> from that <hi>taken away</hi> by the <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> I ſay are given exactly till the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Thunders unſeal'd</hi> thirty additional Days to the 1260

                  <p>And it is much to be obſerv'd, This ſo clear Line is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven here, as in the <hi>Revelat.</hi> after a Suppoſition of the <hi>Book open'd</hi> at the <hi>Half-time,</hi> and not before, except in this Cypher of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>Time, Times, Half-Time,</hi> not to be underſtood but by the 1260 <hi>Days,</hi> and other <hi>Apocalyptical</hi> Lines.</p>
                  <p>Now from all this may be collected, by compare with the <hi>Apocalyptick Prophecy,</hi> a <hi>Line of Time,</hi> as exact as from the very <hi>Ages of the Patriarks,</hi> allowing the <hi>Hebrew Copies</hi> there, and the <hi>prophetical Days</hi> for <hi>Years</hi> here.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, the 2300 <hi>Ev.

                  <p>The <hi>ſealed Time</hi> and of the <hi>Book ſhut,</hi> by the <hi>Apocalyptick Prophecy,</hi> in ſo orderly a Progreſs as by compare with <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi> it is found, cannot but be acknowledg'd to be 400 Years from the <hi>last half-week ending.</hi> Then the 1335 are ſo cloſe joyn'd, that they cannot be forc'd aſunder, and ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted into the <hi>End,</hi> both by being a farther Reſolution to <hi>Daniel</hi> (in his Complaint of not <hi>underſtanding)</hi> for his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Wonders,</hi> as alſo by the Bleſſedneſs, and <hi>Daniel's ſtanding in his Lot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, the Evidence from the <hi>Indictions</hi> ſo open and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, is not ſmall: But what could <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Lot in the

It is impoſſible then the <hi>days</hi> ſhould fly back from the <hi>End:</hi> theſe therefore being the whole of the 2300, except 75, the 75 muſt be plac'd in the Forefront of all the <hi>Number,</hi> as we have ſeen, what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Words going forth</hi> hath been found ſo to place juſt ſo many: And if we allow that <hi>Number</hi> to be 75, there is as great a certainty the <hi>ſealed Time</hi> muſt be juſt <hi>four hundred;</hi> for one adjuſts the other neceſſarily; if 75 before the <hi>Weeks,</hi> there muſt be 400 between the <hi>Weeks</hi> or 490 Years, and the 1335; if 400 there, then 75 here; for ſo the 2300 require. Now how each of theſe Spaces of Time, the 400 of the <hi>Seals,</hi> the <hi>Time, Times, Half-time,</hi> or <hi>twelve hundred ſixty days</hi> of the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> the Thirty of the <hi>Voices,</hi> the <hi>forty five of the Vials;</hi> how theſe, I ſay, are all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh'd with their proper Furniture, we muſt be inſtructed by the <hi>Prophecy of the Revelation.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, It muſt be of neceſſity agreeable to the Excellency of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> there ſhould be, beſides many Inciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Prophecies,</hi> ſo <hi>divinely majestick</hi> a <hi>Prophecy,</hi> as this of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Temple of Prophecies,</hi> whoſe <hi>Symbols</hi> ſhould be ſo high and lofty, its Light more clear and full, its Lines of Time, in what it pleas'd to give, more evident and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; the Doctrines intermingled more ſpiritual, the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes more heavenly, and explain'd; the Threats more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and more open; that in every thing there may be a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comingneſs of All to the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> unveil'd, fulfill'd, and excell'd in the <hi>New.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And accordingly, we ſhall find all theſe, to the very height, taken care of and adjuſted; we ſhall ſee this all along the <hi>Iconiſms</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of Things in the <hi>Churches,</hi> in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Viſions,</hi> in the <hi>Doctrines,</hi> in the ſolemn mentions of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> of his <hi>Blood</hi> ſo often <hi>memorializ'd,</hi> as an Antidote againſt the Poiſon of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Miniſteries of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> and their moſt peremptory Abhorrence of all <hi>Worſhip</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to them; Its only <hi>numbred</hi> Line of Time, till the 1000 Years, is ſo often repeated and aſcertain'd; that it does in all things illuſtriouſly ſhew it ſelf to be <hi>that grand Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, which God gave him to ſhew to his Servants</hi> to the tranſcendent Honour of <hi>the Son, by whom he thus ſpake laſt</hi> of all; <hi>Who is the Heir of all things,</hi> eſpecially of the <hi>World to</hi>

                  <p>So that to raviſh this from the Search and Enquiry of his <hi>Church,</hi> or by Imputations of immodeſt Preſumption to bar from it the utmoſt Endeavours of <hi>his Servants,</hi> to compare ſo great a <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and its Events, is to take from them one of

                  </p>
                  <p>That which this <hi>Prophecy reveals,</hi> is the glorious <hi>Reſtitution of all things in the Kingdom of Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Reign</hi> with <hi>his Saints,</hi> the <hi>Deſtruction</hi> and <hi>Conſumption</hi> of all the <hi>wicked, ſo as to be no more</hi> as they have been in <hi>God's Creation</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> Pſal. 104. 35.</p>
                  <p>The Senſe, in which it <hi>reveals,</hi> is not only <hi>Prophetical,</hi> Doctrinal, and Verbal, but Real and Eventual; and that immediately from the very Beginning of it.

                  <p>For though the <hi>Apocalytical Prophecy</hi> was not actually gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> till ſome years after; yet, as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> calls the future, ſo that which is paſt, to the preſent Time; and repreſents in an entire Frame both together, a Priviledge, as to that which is paſt, neceſſarily allowed to <hi>Hiſtory and to a prophetick Frame</hi> much more, when it hath occaſion for it.</p>

                  <p>The Paſſage or Conveyance of this <hi>Apocalyptical</hi> Time, is through the <hi>ſeven Churches,</hi> comprehending the whole Time within themſelves, as alſo Symbols proper to the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> as peculiar to the <hi>Chriſtian Church;</hi> and then the whole Time begins again, and runs in <hi>ſeven Seals, ſeven Trumpets, ſeven Voices,</hi> as <hi>unſeal'd Thunders, ſeven Vials,</hi> as ſo many Conduits,

                  <p>So then this is the only true proper Diviſion of this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> into its <hi>two Syſtemes</hi> of the <hi>Churches,</hi> and then riſe the <hi>Seals, Trumpets, Voices, Vials,</hi> in another <hi>Syſteme,</hi> ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things relating to the Church by <hi>Imperial Motions, Mutations,</hi> and <hi>Times.</hi> And in the latter <hi>Syſteme,</hi> all theſe <hi>Tubes of Time</hi> are each <hi>Sett</hi> of them, and each of each <hi>Sett</hi> ſo united one to another, that they can neither be disjoyn'd from their immediate ſequence one upon another, nor mov'd out of their order; ſo that the <hi>Trumpets</hi> follow the <hi>Seals;</hi> the <hi>Voices</hi> the <hi>Trumpets;</hi> the <hi>Vials</hi> the <hi>Voices;</hi> and each <hi>Seal, Trumpet, Voice,</hi> and <hi>Vial,</hi> follows immediately upon its fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>Seal, Trumpet, Voice,</hi> and <hi>Vial;</hi> and every <hi>ſeventh</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the following <hi>Sevens,</hi> the <hi>ſeventh Seal,</hi> the <hi>ſeven Trumpets,</hi> the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> the <hi>ſeven Voices,</hi> the <hi>ſeventh Voice,</hi> the <hi>ſeven Vials;</hi> and each precedent <hi>Seventh</hi> hath ſome graſp on all the following <hi>Sevens.</hi> So the <hi>ſeventh Seal</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> the <hi>Voices,</hi> the <hi>Vials;</hi> the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet</hi> the <hi>Voices</hi> and <hi>Vials;</hi> the <hi>ſeventh Voice</hi> the <hi>ſeven Vials;</hi> ſo admirably is this <hi>Prophecy united</hi> and <hi>interwoven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to other Diviſion than this of the ſecond <hi>Systeme of Prophecies,</hi> I can by no means ſubſcribe; as <hi>of the Prophecy</hi> divided into the <hi>ſealed</hi> and <hi>open Book-prophecy;</hi> or the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> firſt, and then <hi>of the Church.</hi> For that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable part of the <hi>ſealed Book-prophecy, viz.</hi> the <hi>palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing Company,</hi> by peculiar Right pertains to the <hi>open Book,</hi> or that muſt be ſo, if there were ſuch an <hi>open Book-prophecy;</hi> and much of the <hi>open Book-prophecy,</hi> allowing ſuch a one, muſt needs pertain to the <hi>ſealed:</hi> but indeed there is no ſuch Thing as an <hi>open Book-prophecy</hi> in that place, where it is ſaid to be <hi>open'd;</hi> for the Book was no ſooner open'd but it was <hi>eaten,</hi> and ſo <hi>abſconded</hi> aſſoon as <hi>open'd,</hi> till <hi>open'd</hi> by the <hi>Voices, c.</hi> 14. as ſhall be farther clear'd: nor is there any <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Syſteme,</hi> but pertains properly to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41903:35"/> the <hi>Church,</hi> as within firſt the <hi>Pagan,</hi> then the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> then the <hi>Beſtian State of the one Roman Empire,</hi> and laſtly of the <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now in this Order <hi>apocalyptical,</hi> Both <hi>Viſions</hi> and <hi>Times</hi> in the <hi>firſt Syſteme,</hi> run through the <hi>ſix Churches,</hi> In the ſecond through thoſe <hi>four Sets</hi> of prophetical Tubes, <hi>Seals c.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 8. to <hi>v.</hi> of Trumpets, <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 8. to the end of <hi>c.</hi> 11. of <hi>Voices, c.</hi> 14. of the <hi>Vials, c.</hi> 15. <hi>c.</hi> 16. and ſo laying theſe Chapters together, the order is moſt exact, except that in <hi>c.</hi> 7. There is an Anticipation of the Triumph of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> from <hi>v.</hi> 9. to the end. In <hi>c.</hi> 11. there is a Collection of the whole State of the <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> during the <hi>ſix Trumpets,</hi> into one Body together, as it conſiſts of the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and the <hi>Tyranny of the Beſtian Apoſtaſie,</hi> excepting ſome cloſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations in the very Compoſure of the <hi>Symboliſms</hi> of thoſe <hi>Trumpets</hi> [for the great Reaſons hereafter to be given,] that refer to the ſame <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and begin at the <hi>firſt Trumpet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then in the twelfth and thirteenth Chapters the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſated</hi> Account of the <hi>Dragon, watching the Woman,</hi> and her <hi>manly Birth,</hi> the <hi>Dragon caſt down,</hi> and the <hi>manly Birth caught up,</hi> is to be reduc'd within its moſt proper Channel; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>ſixth Seals.</hi> And this prepares for the right underſtanding of the Beaſt mention'd <hi>ch.</hi> 11. as deriv'd from the <hi>Dragon, c.</hi> 13. arriving his <hi>Number</hi> 666, which belongs to the <hi>ſix firſt Trumpets;</hi> and it is there fitly ſet to prepare for the <hi>Viſion of the Lambs Number.</hi> c. 14.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Chapters 17. 18. and 19. they are moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the Progreſs of the Hiſtory of the ſeventh <hi>Vial,</hi> and the full Relation of its Effects. To prepare for which, an extraordinary Deſcription of the <hi>Woman,</hi> or Great City <hi>reigning over the Kings of the Earth,</hi> oppoſite to the <hi>Woman in the Wilderneſs,</hi> is prefix'd; and on her occaſion a more perfect Portraicture of the <hi>Beast,</hi> and of his <hi>ten Horns</hi> or <hi>Kings</hi> is given, in preparation to the Judgment executed on all, <hi>c.</hi> 19. And then the <hi>Milennial State</hi> being drawn up, <hi>c.</hi> 20. it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to the end of <hi>Apocalyptical Time,</hi> as it reaches into
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41903:35"/> the complemental State of <hi>Eternity,</hi> which the <hi>Prophecy</hi> briefly abſolves, and then returns upon its more proper Subject, or the 1000 Years of the <hi>New Jeruſalem. c.</hi> 21. <hi>c.</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>Now this Order began with the Preface to the Churches <hi>Viſion</hi> of <hi>the first Syſteme, c.</hi> 1. and then the Preface of the <hi>ſecond Syſteme,</hi> and laſtly a Poſtſcript, returning eſpecially <note place="margin">c. 4. c. 5. c. 22. 16.</note> to the <hi>Vials</hi> as given by the <hi>first Angel of the Vials.</hi> This Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is, I ſay, the whole entire natural Order of this <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyptical Prophecy;</hi> which is contriv'd indeed ſuitable to the Secrecy and Myſticneſs of the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> ſo as often ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to declare, when theſe <hi>Prophecies</hi> would have the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt efficacious Diſcoveries in the <hi>Church, viz.</hi> after the <hi>Half Time,</hi> when the <hi>Thunders</hi> had <hi>utter'd</hi> their <hi>Voices,</hi> and the <hi>Book open,</hi> was <hi>ſhewn in the hand of Christ.</hi> That was the juſt Seaſon for the Diſcovery of the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> in the <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and the <hi>Tenthly Fall of the City;</hi> and then after the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet</hi> the whole Series of <hi>Viſions</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Beast,</hi> deriv'd from the <hi>Dragon,</hi> will be <hi>beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,</hi> and <hi>moſt fully believ'd;</hi> even as at the <hi>Reformation</hi> there was moſt neceſſarily an Acknowledgment of a long <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> of the cruel <hi>Tyranny</hi> of the Beaſt over true <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and a viſible Pledge; The <hi>Ten Kings</hi> on the <hi>Head of the Beaſt,</hi> that carries the Woman, would at length fall from it: but the End of that <hi>Half-Time</hi> will make a farther, both No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriety and Aſſurance of theſe things.</p>
                  <p>This allowed, the <hi>Prophecy</hi> takes no Freedome, but what is due to the graveſt <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> to place, by way ſometimes of Anticipation, ſometimes of Recollection, the Parts of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> ſo, as may beſt ſerve the Purpoſes of the <hi>Hiſtory:</hi> And yet we cannot deferr ſo little to the Majeſty of <hi>Divine Prophecy,</hi> as is even challengeable by <hi>Humane Hiſtory;</hi> For that is juſtly entitled to a Right of ſecret and inſenſible Tranſitions, Connexions, Tranſpoſitions from one part to another, which require leiſurely Meditation and thoughtful Pauſes, to find them; and yet are ſo plac'd, as when found they give <hi>Light</hi> one to another with <hi>

                  </p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:41903:36"/>
                  <p> Altho therefore I riſe up with greateſt Reverence and Honour to thoſe great Names, who have thought otherwiſe, I can allow no Beginning of <hi>Apocalyptical Time</hi> anew, either at the <hi>open Book ch.</hi> 11. or at <hi>ch.</hi> 12. but only a Recollection of thoſe things after their redundant Swellings out of their Channels, one to the <hi>firſt Trumpet,</hi> the latter to the <hi>fifth Seal;</hi> Only The two Syſtemes have each one and the ſame <hi>Epoch,</hi> given particularly to each: The <hi>Churches</hi> are cloſe and evenly cemented, and ſouldered one to another, and ſo the Seals, Trumpets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their Connexion even <hi>herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically</hi> ſeal'd; And Both from the ſame <hi>Epoch,</hi> the <hi>Reſurrection of Chriſt,</hi> derive themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And as to the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the whole, even as it is a Rule of great uſe in the Interpreting <hi>General Scripture,</hi> that the literal Senſe is to be preferr'd where no <hi>Analogy</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Scripture-Reaſon</hi> is deſtroy'd by it; ſo here the <hi>myſtical ſenſe</hi> is rather to be choſen, where no ſuch Injury is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the <hi>Analogy of Scripture Truth:</hi> and yet as in the one caſe a ſubordinate <hi>myſtical ſenſe</hi> may be allowed; ſo in this, a ſubordinate <hi>literal ſenſe</hi> may be allowed.</p>
                  <p>To give only two or three Inſtances. <hi>Hearing</hi> and <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Prophecy</hi> hath firſt the <hi>myſtical ſenſe</hi> of a cloſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Rules of <hi>Faith, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it; which makes All <hi>Bleſſed</hi> who ſo <hi>read</hi> and ſo <hi>hear,</hi> tho' they do not <hi>interpret,</hi> nor concern themſelves in the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of <hi>this Prophecy;</hi> and yet there is in the <hi>literal ſenſe</hi> an <hi>Accumulative</hi> Honour and Happineſs on thoſe who joyn both theſe Senſes in themſelves together. As on the other ſide, They who add and <hi>take away</hi> by Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm from the <hi>Words of it,</hi> by breaking its Holy Meaſures in <hi>Faith, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> ſhall loſe their <hi>part</hi> in its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and have their part <hi>in its Plagues;</hi> altho they neither <hi>added</hi> nor <hi>took away</hi> in the <hi>litteral ſenſe,</hi> and yet They ſhall receive <hi>accumulative Plagues</hi> who have done the firſt, and then by falſe and diſtorted <hi>Interpretations</hi> added the latter alſo.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:41903:36"/>
                  <p> Thus <hi>Opening the Book of this Prophecy</hi> and its <hi>Seals,</hi> are principally the ſeveral <hi>Effects of the Kingdom of Christ,</hi> and that principal one at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and not the Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Book,</hi> or a new courſe of <hi>Prophecy:</hi> and yet it is ſubordinately true, There was then a greater Clearneſs and Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the whole <hi>Doctrine of the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and a new order, as it were, of <hi>Holy Prophecy</hi> and Inſtruction; And this <hi>Prophecy</hi> did then Recall its own Diſcovery of Things at that Time, after the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> ſo long darkning it and the Goſpel, and enlarge its former brief Notes.</p>
                  <p>And ſo <hi>Coming quickly to paſs</hi> hath the <hi>literal ſenſe,</hi> That then immediately began <hi>Apocalyptical</hi> Events each in their own order, to <hi>come ſpeedily</hi> and <hi>immediately to paſs,</hi> altho' ſo many hundred years run out 'ere all <hi>come to paſs;</hi> As an Army may be ſaid to come preſently when the <hi>Avaunt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers</hi> firſt appear, altho' the <hi>Rere</hi> may be long in coming, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the numerous Body coming on orderly and in juſt Files. Thus every <hi>Apocalyptical</hi> Event was on the Wing, and darted it ſelf into Exiſtence, without the leaſt of <hi>ſlumbring</hi> or <hi>lingring,</hi> when its Time was, to come.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>myſtical ſenſe</hi> is, that whereas that ſublime Event of the <hi>Death and Reſurrection of Christ</hi> roſe up, as a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dividing and parting the former World and Time, from the <hi>latter Time,</hi> or the <hi>laſt Days,</hi> and All beyond the <hi>Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> was as a <hi>Book clos'd</hi> and ſeal'd up, ſo as that it could not, till the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> make an offer of Appearance; Then it did, and therefore then properly <hi>ſeal'd</hi> down with <hi>ſeven Seals:</hi> and yet by their opening it was in a daily motion to its Appearance. But thoſe two Worlds were of ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Lines of Communications, that nothing paſs'd in <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Account into Exiſtence or Being, out of one into the other; even as the World, on the one and the other ſide of the <hi>Equinoctial Line,</hi> are remarkably taken notice of, as two diſtinct Parts of the World, how near ſoever they joyn who are on each ſide next to it. Thus nothing on the <hi>other ſide</hi> the <hi>Line</hi> before the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> was ſo much as <hi>coming to paſs</hi>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:41903:37"/> that was to be after the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> or to have any motion accounted to it. But after that <hi>Reſurrection</hi> every thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the <hi>latter days</hi> is deſcrib'd as <hi>coming quickly to paſs,</hi> each in its own Order, and Time, and knowing its Place, and marching in its own Diſtances; none as that <hi>Army, Joel</hi> 2. 7, 8. <hi>thruſting another,</hi> or <hi>breaking rank;</hi> but all duely plac'd in their <hi>Climes,</hi> as on this ſide the <hi>Line.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now having given this general view of the <hi>Apocalyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Prophecy,</hi> and its Order of Times, I will diſcourſe briefly firſt on the Syſteme of the <hi>Church-Prophecy,</hi> or of the ſeven Churches, and obſerve their Concert with thoſe Lines of Time, that rule the <hi>Evenings</hi> and <hi>Mornings,</hi> or <hi>Nights</hi> and <hi>Days</hi> of <hi>Apocalyptical Time.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>All which, is certainly as Divine a <hi>Symbol</hi> to ſet out the ſupream and ſole Excellency of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as far above all <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi> and <hi>every Name in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Earth,</hi> as could be found out, and ſurpaſſing all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding or Invention finite, and is in ſurprize of any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions

                  <p>The <hi>ſealed Book</hi> being now in the Hands of Chriſt, and all due Acknowledgments made to him that <hi>ſits on the Throne,</hi> and to the <hi>Lamb,</hi> immediately follows the <hi>opening of the Seals,</hi> and therein the Courſe of Time flows out, and ſo flows on; of which we are now to take a particular and ſtrict Account: only I would deſire every Perſon that ſets his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41903:44"/> Mind and Thoughts to view this ſo auguſt <hi>Inthronization</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>of the Lamb,</hi> That he would ponder within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Whether the deſolating either the <hi>Jews</hi> or the <hi>Heathen Empire,</hi> can be Events great enough for ſo ſtupendious a Pre-Repreſentation; or any thing leſs than the <hi>Glorious Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> could anſwer to it.</p>
                  <p>And now, that we may eſtabliſh the Line of Time accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe <hi>Seals,</hi> and the Time of their <hi>opening,</hi> there are three Things to be conſider'd;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What it is that is the principal Jewel and Treaſure that lies under theſe <hi>Seals;</hi> and ſo to be ſet free by the <hi>unlooſing</hi> them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What is the principal and ſupream <hi>Viſum</hi> or Thing to be <hi>ſeen</hi> in every <hi>Seal,</hi> and the <hi>opening</hi> of it, and how it ſerves the diſcloſing that Jewel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What is the true method of fixing the certain Time that the whole Courſe of the <hi>Seals</hi> took up, and how it is to be meaſur'd and fix'd.</p>
                  <p>If we can now determine and ſettle aright upon the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of each of theſe Particulars, we ſhall be able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this firſt Sett of <hi>Apocalyptical Viſions,</hi> and to have ample ſatisfaction concerning them, and have great Light into the following <hi>Viſions</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the Firſt then, That great Treaſure and Jewel of Truth that is inclos'd within theſe <hi>Seals,</hi> and ſo alſo, as we ſhall ſee, that the <hi>Trumpets</hi> ultimately <hi>ſounded</hi> unto, is the <hi>Glorious Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every Event, and the Stage of Time it was to paſs over, is as a <hi>Seal</hi> or Stop upon this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> till it opens into Glory; and the opening of every <hi>Seal</hi> was an Advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it: and although when the <hi>ſeven Seals</hi> were open'd, there appeared a greater and more prodigious Cauſe of Delay, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Antichriſtian Kingdom;</hi> yet every <hi>Trumpet</hi> was as an <hi>Alarm of War</hi> to the ſubduing that <hi>Mock-Kingdom</hi> that roſe in Deſpight and Oppoſition to the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi> And becauſe all things were ſo ſet, and placed in their Seaſon and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41903:45"/> Order, that no one thing could come to paſs before that which was ſet before it had had its free Egreſs and Event, therefore every of theſe Events, and the opening of the <hi>Seals</hi> to let them out, though they did not in the Iſſue <hi>open</hi> to the true <hi>Appearance of that Kingdom,</hi> yet becauſe they did as it were, what they could, and there was a Remove of ſo many <hi>Prohibents,</hi> or Obſtacles to that <hi>Kingdom;</hi> and Time ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd from Point to Point, that by the <hi>opening every Seal</hi> the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> might be nearer to its <hi>Appearance;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are juſtly underſtood, and expounded to be <hi>Seals, unloos'd,</hi> and <hi>opening to the Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now beſides thoſe <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or IT IS DONE, IT IS DONE, at the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Apocalyptical Time</hi> and all its Events, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they one and all run together; beſides this, there is this abſolute Aſſurance, That the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> was under the <hi>Seals;</hi> The Kingdom made ſo magnificent a ſhow of it ſelf at the <hi>ſixth Seal,</hi> that had not the <hi>Servants of God been ſeal'd in their Fore-heads,</hi> that they ſhould not then <hi>appear</hi> with him in <hi>Glory,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom</hi> had even then <hi>appear'd;</hi> for in <hi>Conſtantine's Chriſtian Empire,</hi> to the End of the <hi>Reign,</hi> or at the Victory of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great over <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> of which he endeavour'd the utter Extirpation, that <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſo far <hi>came</hi> out of its Retirement, that there was a ſolemn and loud <hi>Doxology</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> that the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> and the <hi>Power of Christ</hi> were <hi>come;</hi> and yet at the very ſame time, the <hi>Woman,</hi> is recorded as <hi>fled into the Wilderneſs,</hi> Rev. 12. 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The firſt Particular then being reſolved with ſo much Evidence and Aſſurance, we may with the greateſt Clearneſs reſolve concerning the ſecond or the principal <hi>Viſum</hi> of every <hi>Seal open'd:</hi> for it muſt be ſome State of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Chriſt defin'd by the joyning together the <hi>Voices</hi> that ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to the Sight and Obſervation ſo far, as theſe <hi>Voices</hi> continued; and then, when they ceaſed, the State of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> muſt be conſidered by the <hi>Viſa</hi> themſelves, as under the Ceſſation of thoſe <hi>Voices,</hi> and by any ſort of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41903:45"/> 
                     <hi>Voices</hi> we can find equivalent to them. And in this Method, and no other, that I can underſtand, we may juſtly and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehend the Intention and Signification of the <hi>Seals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if all the <hi>Seals</hi> carry on the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> by ſo many Degrees and Steps of Advance, as I have in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I hope, made evident they do; By undeniable Proof then it muſt needs be, That every <hi>Seal</hi> hath ſome State of that <hi>Kingdom</hi> protuberant or ſwelling out in its <hi>Appearance</hi> upon that <hi>opening,</hi> and that the <hi>Voice</hi> that ſays, <hi>Come and ſee,</hi> calls to obſerve it, and the <hi>ſilence</hi> of any ſuch <hi>Voice</hi> moves En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, Why there is no ſuch <hi>Voice?</hi> and every <hi>Viſum,</hi> or Thing to be <hi>ſeen</hi> in both ſorts of <hi>Seals,</hi> the <hi>Voic'd,</hi> or the ſeemingly <hi>ſilent Seals,</hi> are to be judg'd of, as they have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> eſpecially becauſe we ſhall find the three laſt <hi>Seals</hi> without <hi>Voices,</hi> have ſomething to ſupply the want of the <hi>Voices</hi> of thoſe <hi>four Living Creatures.</hi>

                  </p>

                  <p n="1">1.

There was a <hi>pure Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> yet publick and <hi>viſible,</hi> but upon the Retreat; for it was juſt now retiring, and about to be <hi>ſeal'd,</hi> that is, under that <hi>over-growing Synagogue.</hi> 3. This Kingdom of Chriſt in his Church was to have (abating the general Unhappineſs of fallen ſinful Man) a more quiet and illuſtrious State than heretofore, <hi>viz.</hi> in a <hi>Chriſtian Empire;</hi> for till the whole Time <hi>of ſealing the Servants of God</hi> was paſt, the <hi>four Angels,</hi> that had the <hi>four firſt Trumpets,</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>hold the Wind,</hi> that no ſuch <hi>Hurt</hi> could be done upon the <hi>Empire,</hi> as was after to be done when they <hi>ſounded.</hi> This was <hi>Smyrna</hi>'s Crown.

                  <p>The State of <hi>Chriſts Kingdom</hi> is to be underſtood, 1.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41903:51"/> Event ceaſes, the Ceſſation of the Event comes in the place, where that Ceſſation may create a <hi>Symbol;</hi> And this could be no way thus modelled, but by ſo ſupream an Authour, who is not only the Artificer of the <hi>Symbols,</hi> but the <hi>Opifex</hi> the abſolute <hi>Operator</hi> of the <hi>Events</hi> themſelves, The Reaſon, why the <hi>living Creatures</hi> ſpoke no more after the <hi>Fourth Seal,</hi> was, not only becauſe there were but <hi>Four living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> but alſo becauſe the Pure <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Miniſtry there ceas'd; The Reaſon, why the <hi>Souls cryed under the Altar,</hi> was not only becauſe the <hi>Martyrdomes</hi> under the <hi>Pagan Empire</hi> were then compleated, That all of that Roll might joyn in that appeal to God, but becauſe that was the moſt Pure and Excellent Voice the <hi>Church</hi> had then left to ſpeak to God in, the <hi>Voice</hi> of <hi>Martyrs Blood,</hi> that when they were dead, yet <hi>ſpoke,</hi> for after this the <hi>Church</hi> ſpoke no more, ſo as to be heard till after the <hi>Apoſtacy;</hi> nor did the <hi>four living Creatures</hi> or <hi>twenty four Elders</hi> appear any more after this <hi>Seal</hi> till then; c. 11. 20. And this <hi>Cry</hi> was tim'd juſt before that amazing change in the World, that <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Converſion produc'd. The Reaſon why an <hi>Angels</hi> Voice remarqu'd the <hi>ſixth Seal,</hi> except only as that ſo wonderful Event of the Deſolation of <hi>Heatheniſm</hi> ſpoke it ſelf, was becauſe the Kingdom of Chriſt was greater in the <hi>ſealing</hi> of ſo many of his <hi>Servants</hi> to be hidden under the <hi>Antichriſtian Kingdom,</hi> then, that very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of <hi>Constantine,</hi> which as it let out the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> ſo far as in an <hi>Emblem,</hi> let out the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Kingdom</hi> alſo by accident, that juſt then the 144000 were <hi>ſeal'd,</hi> and the <hi>Woman</hi> took her <hi>Flight into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Laſtly, the Reaſon why <hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> without any audible <hi>Voice</hi> ſolemnize this <hi>Seal,</hi> is, becauſe the pure Service was reducing to the ſilent, private <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>meaſured Temple, Altar,</hi> and its <hi>Worſhipers,</hi> and the publick <hi>Tammith Daily,</hi> or <hi>continual Pure Worſhip</hi> was about to be <hi>taken away</hi> by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Intruſion into the <hi>outward Court.</hi> Chap. 11. 1.

                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:41903:51"/>
                  <p> Yet at this Time the Worſhip was both publick and pure in Gods Account, and the <hi>Prayers of all Saints came up as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe</hi> before him, and the Proſecution, the <hi>Kingdom opened in all the Seals,</hi> had made againſt <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> was completed in <hi>Theodoſius</hi>'s <hi>Famous Victory against it,</hi> imported in the <hi>ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Altar-Incens'd Fire</hi> of his and all Chriſtians <hi>memorializ'd Prayer,</hi> in the midſt of the Battel with <hi>Eugenius;</hi> upon which followed <hi>Voices, Thunderings, Lightnings,</hi> and an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> the uſual <hi>Symbols</hi> in this <hi>Prophecy</hi> of all the Acquiſts and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valencies of <hi>Chriſts Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So the State of the Empire was during this Time a State of Reſpite, Quiet, Peace, or Victoriouſneſs, and Greatneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Favour of the <hi>Precept</hi> given to the <hi>four Angels,</hi> that <hi>held the four Winds,</hi> which <hi>Precept</hi> was yet in full Force and Vertue.</p>
                  <p>But all this was but for an <hi>Half-hour,</hi> an imperfect, decur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Time, ſeiz'd and ſurpriz'd from its Perfection, [as the <hi>Beaſt's Times</hi> have been, and much more ſhall be yet within the <hi>Half<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>time:]</hi> The <hi>Purity of Worſhip</hi> was ſurpris'd by the <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> by the <hi>Antichriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> being immediately in Preparation; The <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> no ſooner vindicated from <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> but merg'd in <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> and ſo purſued by Vengeance that puniſh'd the former in the latter; and ſo alſo made way by a high myſterious Counſel of Juſtice, for the <hi>Antichriſtian King,</hi> while it deſtroy'd the <hi>Antichriſtianiz'd Empire.</hi>

                  <p>That then, which I ſhall firſt addreſs our Thoughts unto, ſhall be to conſider every Character of <hi>Time,</hi> given us in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, by its ſelf, with its Signification and Extent, and the Aſſurances it is of ſuch ſignification and Extent; then the Balances of the <hi>Characters</hi> one with another; and laſtly, their ſeveral Epochs and Periods.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Character of Prophetick Time, is <hi>Time, Times, Half a Time,</hi> or if tranſlated exactly, either according to the <note place="margin">Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter firſt.</note> Originals of the Old or New Teſtament, and according to the very Deſign of Prophecy, it is <hi>Appointed Time, Appointed Times, Appointed Half Time,</hi> or, <hi>Seaſon, Seaſons, half a Seaſon;</hi> and ſo in that firſt Diſtribution of Time according to the Motion of the Sun, and the Moon, the great Luminaries of Heaven, it is uſed <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1. 14. for Deſign'd and Appointed Times; and this is very neceſſary to be layd in the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; For accordingly it will follow, The meaſures of this <hi>Seaſon, Seaſons, half a Seaſon,</hi> muſt be found out by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41903:54"/> the meaſures of the other Notes of Time wherewith they are joyned; for that Character of <hi>Seaſon</hi> it ſelf ſpeaks high, and notorious Deſignation of this <hi>Time, Times, Half a Time;</hi> and that moſt remarkable <hi>Seaſon</hi> (of which after-uſe is to be made) ariſes from ſuch a Deſignation, and not an immediate Definition of the Space.</p>
                  <p>But then ſecondarily, Becauſe a <hi>Year,</hi> and a <hi>Day,</hi> are the moſt natural and ready Meaſures of deſigned Time, and ſo may in that forenam'd Scripture be the Explanation of <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 14.</note> or remarkable and ſignaliz'd <hi>Times,</hi> as they are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately added to <hi>Seaſons:</hi> and becauſe in all probability, <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Times</hi> paſſing over <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> under his <hi>Delirium,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan,</hi> 4. 23.</note> mean ſeven Years, ſince they cannot mean Days or Months, or leſs than Years, nor more, we may firſt conſider <hi>Time, Times, Half a Time,</hi> as three Years and a half, and that with Authority, becauſe they are diverſifyed into other ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of Time or Spaces, as we ſhall ſee, that point to ſo much.</p>
                  <p>So then the ſignification of <hi>Time, Times, Half a Time,</hi> is taken from that firſt moſt known and honourable Account of Time, the Suns Motion from Point to Point in its annual Circle: This is a more honourable Circulation than that of a Day, becauſe the Sun more knownly varies every day from the Point from which, and the Point to which it daily moves, which makes the change of the Year to thoſe ſeveral Seaſons; ſo that although, as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>The Sun riſeth and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down, and haſteth to the place where he aroſe,</hi> diſtributing Day and Night to the World; yet he neither ſets nor riſes two Days together at the ſame exact Point, but veres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one of the Tropicks; although therefore a Day of the Suns being with us is the moſt noble meaſure of Time next to the Year, yet it cannot deſerve the Name of a Time, of a ſignaliz'd Time, as a Year doth; both becauſe it is not ſo exact to a Point of Revolution, and becauſe it is not ſo full; a Year excelling a Day in being the greater and ampler, and ſo the moſt perfect, known, and generally obſerv'd Circle for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41903:55"/> a <hi>Seaſon,</hi> comprehending that of a Day above three hundred ſixty five times within it ſelf; and is the Suns perfect Emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuration of its way from one end to the other end of the Heavens, and of its Viſitation of the whole Earth with its Beams.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Year</hi> muſt yet more excel a Month than it does a Day, becauſe the Sun hath the Government of the Day, and of the Year; but the Moon, the much more ignoble Planet, and Governeſs only of the Night, gives to the Months their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Meaſure; and tho there are twelve Points of the Space the Sun emenſurates in a Year, <hi>viz.</hi> the twelve Signs in the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> and the Suns firſt Touch upon <hi>Aries,</hi> to its gliding off from it to the next Sign, may be call'd a Solar Month; yet neither is it the proper Month, which is defin'd by Lunations, nor is it any Circulation of the Sun with it ſelf, or with its own Motion, or with its great end of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing the World with its enlivening Beams: there is no ſpace therefore that can properly merit the Name of a Time or Seaſon in the firſt place, but a Year firſt, and then a Day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Times,</hi> abſolutely ſo call'd, muſt needs alſo be moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>two Times,</hi> for the firſt Plurality, or more than one is two; and the more ſo, becauſe it is ſet betwixt one Time, and half a time; for that Number, which exceeds, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves from Unity firſt, is two; and that which is bounded by half a Time in its remove from one Time, can be no more than two; for if it had proceeded to more than two, and had not been ſtop'd or cut off, as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſignificantly, <hi>It had been three Times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Half a Time</hi> therefore, as it refers to the Beaſts Time, muſt be Time decurtated, or cut off at the middle, (as the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Beards of <hi>David</hi>'s Servants, half'd by <hi>Hanun</hi> in Diſgrace and Diſhonour) to the Beaſts eternal Infamy, and in recompence to his ſurpriſe of the Churches Peace, and Purity, at its half Hour, as ſhall be noted. <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 8. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Time</hi> then, as One, denotes Beginning, as One is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Number; <hi>Times,</hi> as <hi>Two,</hi> denotes Increaſe and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41903:55"/> Conſiſtency, as it is a progreſs of Time from One, and ſettles in the firſt even Number; Half ſpeaks an endeavour of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be continued, but ſurpris'd, and cut off at its middle.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe <hi>Time, Times, Half a Time,</hi> might ſignifie only the three Years and a half they firſt import; but that they muſt ſignifie more, we ſhall find very full aſſurance: when therefore we ſhall have reaſon'd that it muſt be more than three Years and a half, it will then appear moſt reaſonable, that <hi>each Time</hi> ſhould have its moſt perfect Circle: And if a Year be the perfecteſt Circle of Time, then a Year of Years muſt be the moſt perfect and full Circle, beyond which there can be nothing, but a Repetition, or Multiplication of the ſame again and again: ſo then the <hi>Time</hi> muſt be a Year of Years, the <hi>two Times</hi> muſt be the ſame Circle twice told, and the <hi>Half Time</hi> the ſame Circle attempted the third Time, and clip'd off at the Semicircle; which is the Account of this Character of <hi>Time, Times, Half a Time,</hi> and which is the firſt, and, as will appear, the moſt comprehenſive of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of this Line: and tho there may be other Revolutions of the Heavens, and of the Sun, particularly known to learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Aſtronomers, containing greater numbers of Years, and there is a more perfect Number alſo of Years, <hi>viz. the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years</hi> given us in this Prophecy, as we ſhall ſee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; yet there is none ſo fit to the preſent Purpoſe as <hi>Days</hi> and <hi>Years,</hi> nor ſo full as a Year of Days, and then a Year of Years, or of prophetical Days, moſt agreeable to Prophecy every way.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the ſecond Character of <hi>Days:</hi> A <hi>Day</hi> then <note place="margin">Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter the Second.</note> is the firſt moſt known and obſervable date of Time, as it was firſt in uſe to meaſure Time by; <hi>The Evening and the Morning were the first Day,</hi> aſſoon as Time began: A <hi>Day</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 5. &amp;c.</note> then is the Time in which the Sun performs his Motion (ſpeaking as the Scripture does to general Apprehenſion, without regard to ſtrictneſſes of Philoſophy, whether the Motion be of the Sun or of the Earth) from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West,</hi> and gives Light to one of the Hemiſpheres, and then from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41903:56"/> 
                     <hi>West</hi> to <hi>East,</hi> and ſo haſtens to the Place where he aroſe as near as the aforeſaid Variation will allow, and gives Light to the other Hemiſphere, as Lord of the Day to the World of both Hemiſpheres.</p>
                  <p>As then on this Account <hi>Days</hi> are in all Languages expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of length of Time, ſo one Day was by God made choice of to ſignifie a Year, and one Day by <hi>Moſes, Pſal.</hi> 90. and by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> is ſingled out to parallel with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years; and <hi>Man's Day,</hi> by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> is us'd to expreſs the whole courſe of Man's time of judging, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8.</note> to the Day of Judgment: and the whole courſe of <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3.</note> Judgment is call'd frequently the <hi>Day of Judgment,</hi> as <hi>one Day;</hi> and as it is taken a Day for a Year in this Line of Time, ſo we ſhall find in the <hi>three Days and a half</hi> it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Years,</hi> equal to a <hi>Year</hi> of <hi>Years.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Day</hi> threfore is a Standard of Time fairly to be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to any Meaſure of Time, the Conjunction it hath with ſuch Meaſure otherwiſe given requires: when therefore three Days and a half are joyn'd with twelve hundred ſixty Days, with twice forty two Months, and all theſe within <hi>Time, Times, Half a time,</hi> there is a fair Reaſon to underſtand them of the very ſame Tenor of Time with what they are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd.</p>
                  <p>But as for the accounting a <hi>Day</hi> for a <hi>Year,</hi> that reſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Divine Inſtitution of a Day for a Year, firſt in a Caſe near and parallel; of the Forty Years Commoration of the Church of <hi>Iſrael, Numb.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 34. (to omit <hi>Jacob</hi>'s old Stile of Time, a <hi>Week</hi> of <hi>Years)</hi> in the Wilderneſs, and after that by the ſolemn Inſtitution, as of a prophetical Key, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. <hi>I have appointed a Day for a Year;</hi> ſo that when there is a concurrence of Prophecy, and Things to be tranſacted, that cannot be tranſacted in ſo ſhort a ſpace as of Days litterally and naturally underſtood; they muſt be ſo underſtood, as we are directed by Prophecy to underſtand them; <hi>viz.</hi> a Day for a Year, even as without Heſitation we compute into Weeks of Years <hi>Daniel</hi>'s ſeventy Weeks, and ſo into 490 Years.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:41903:56"/>
                  <p> Now we ſhall find ſuch Tranſactions, fitted to the <hi>twelve hundred and ſixty days,</hi> that cannot poſſibly be ſuppos'd to have their Motion in <hi>three years and a half,</hi> ſo that they muſt be Prophetical <hi>days,</hi> or <hi>days</hi> for <hi>years.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus we have ſettled the two firſt, and moſt noble <hi>Characters</hi> of <hi>Time;</hi> A <hi>year</hi> ſignified by a <hi>time,</hi> and a <hi>day,</hi> as it is uſed in the <hi>three dayes</hi> and a <hi>half,</hi> and in the <hi>twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty days,</hi> with their moſt truly Prophetical Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, <hi>viz.</hi> three <hi>years</hi> and a <hi>half</hi> of <hi>years,</hi> in the <hi>three times,</hi> and three <hi>days</hi> and a half, and twelve hundred and ſixty <hi>years</hi> in the 1260 <hi>days.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us then proceed to the <hi>third Character</hi> of <hi>Months,</hi> or the <hi>forty two Months.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Month</hi> then, we know, is that Space of Time the Moon deſcribes by Night, in its progreſs through the <hi>Zodiack;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Third Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> For whatever Hemiſphere it moves in, it is ſtill Night it rules in, which Motion is indeed ſo full of Variation and Incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in its Remove from the <hi>Ecliptick Line,</hi> the Sun's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Path, that it is ſaid, The Sun knows its way, but the Moon does not; even as the <hi>Phaſis,</hi> or figure of the Moon is upon perpetual change, even to a Proverb, upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjuſtableneſs of any ones Humour or Manners; <hi>Who can</hi> (ſaith the Proverb) <hi>fit a Coat to the Moon?</hi> and ſo is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently adapted to deſcribe the Antichriſtian Tyranny that changes <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Laws.</hi> Not onely by reſcinding the truly Chriſtian Laws, by mens own Additions, contrary to thoſe Laws themſelves; but alſo making perpetually changeable, even the Counterfeits of them, by innumerable new Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; whereas the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>yeſterday, and to day, the ſame for ever.</hi> Beſides that <hi>Judaiſme</hi> and <hi>Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme,</hi> that had ſo many dependencies on the Moon, is the Conſtitution of <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> and therefore the true Church, ſo diſtant from it, is cloathed with the Sun, and hath the Moon under its feet, and therein abdicates <hi>Judaiſm, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm,</hi> and <hi>Mahometaniſm,</hi> (that alſo claims a Kindred with the Moon) as the Votaries of the Moon.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:41903:57"/>
                  <p> Now this Moon, as Governeſs of the Night, as ſo variable in its Motions and Meaſures, gives no Rule of Time by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Eaſt to Weſt, but only from one Lunation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it denominates <hi>Months</hi> or <hi>Moons,</hi> being certain onely in this, to return from one Conjunction of the Sun to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which, becauſe it gives a new Phaſe to the Moon, is therefore called in the Hebrew <hi>Novitas,</hi> and the Lunations <hi>Novitates,</hi> or New Moons.</p>
                  <p>But I underſtand No Way that it can deſcribe the Circle of a <hi>Year,</hi> but by its Attendance on the Sun in its Motion, by ſo many new Conjunctions as will moſt agree with the Annual Motion of the Sun; and the neareſt This can be brought to by the Natural Motions of the Moon, there will be between Ten and Eleven Days betwixt the Motion of the Sun and the motion of the Moon upon twelve Conjunctions (call'd therefore Synodical Months) of the Moon with the Sun; For ſo many the Sun requires more to the finiſhing its Annual Courſe, than the Moon needs to its twelve Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions with the Sun. And this be ſpoken of <hi>Months,</hi> as they are moſt properly to be underſtood of <hi>Lunations.</hi> For if we would interpret them of <hi>Solar Months,</hi> beſides another grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Obſtruction, or Caution to be entred againſt that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation hereafter, they could be only <hi>progreſſive,</hi> not <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,</hi> and ſo not agreeable with a <hi>day</hi> or a <hi>year,</hi> there being more of a Circulation of motion by that moſt <hi>Illuſtrious Prince of Time</hi> in a <hi>day</hi> than in a <hi>Month.</hi> And therefore we account a Day the firſt Circle of the Sun's motion, with Light from Eaſt to Weſt, and ſo to Eaſt again; and a <hi>Year</hi> the moſt perfect Circle of his motion, in going forth from one end of Heaven, and in Circuit to the other end thereof, with Heat and Influential Vertue; in neither of which <hi>Solar Months</hi> correſpond, as to any Complement, and therefore not ſo fit Symbols of Time as the <hi>Lunar Months,</hi> which have a circle from one Conjunction to the Sun with another.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe <hi>Lunar Months</hi> are in conjunction with Time, Times, Half a Time, or three years and a half of <hi>Years;</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41903:57"/> with Twelve hundred ſixty <hi>Days</hi> or <hi>Years;</hi> Twice Forty two <hi>Months</hi> of <hi>Years</hi> alſo, but the former coaleſcing, or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into One within the latter, as a River that had been a River before may be ſuppos'd to do into a new Cut, or Channel, prepar'd to receive the confluence of neighbouring Waters, lying in the way of that former River, ſo near, that by the great confluence of Waters, and the more ample Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the new River, the old may be deriv'd into it, and ſo make the much greater River, and having made their way, as ſo united, ſome Leagues, the Old River, its Name, and Memory, are ſwallow'd up in the New: ſo are the <hi>Gentiles forty two months</hi> merg'd in the <hi>Forty two months</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and both coextend the <hi>Twelve hundred ſixty days,</hi> and no more.</p>

                  <p>I Have thus far ſettled the General <hi>Sciagraphy,</hi> or Land-Scaph of this <hi>Prophetical Line of Time,</hi> and ſhall now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make a farther penetration into the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and its ſeveral Characters, by enquiry into its ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, its extent in every one of theſe Characters, and the Balance of every one of them, each with the other, and that not by an over-critical reſtraint of the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe to every Head, but in ſuch a communication of the Extent, the balance of the Characters one with another, that the moſt perfect knowledge of the whole may ariſe from them together, as they moſt naturally fall one into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41903:58"/>
                  <p> It is then to be known in the Second General;</p>
                  <p>There are two ſtates of Things, and two kinds of Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages; <note place="margin">Second General.</note> and in ſucceſſive Communities, and Incorporations, each of them are to be found; both which appertain to this Line of <hi>Time,</hi> and the <hi>Characters</hi> of Time are diſtinctly ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to each, <hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>tyranny</hi> of that King, the Scripture-Prophecy calls the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>his Gentiles,</hi> and to the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>true Church</hi> and <hi>Servants of God,</hi> under that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>
                  <p>The whole maſs of Time is therefore divided into the Time of the Night, under the Conduct of the Moon, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as hath been ſaid, of the Night, and into the Time of the Day, and the Light under the Government of the Sun, the Prince of the Day. And this is agreeable to that long Line of Time, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 14. <hi>viz. The twenty three hundred E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening-Morning;</hi> for ſo they are expreſſed in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> that while the <hi>twenty three hundred</hi> notes by ſuch a number, the length of the ſpace, the <hi>Evening-Morning</hi> is all but one Evening, and one Morning; and ſo it is call'd, <hi>The Viſion of the Evening. and of the Morning,</hi> verſe 26.</p>
                  <p>As then it is called the <hi>Viſion of the Evening and the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> ſo the Evening is but One, and the Morning but One. As they are 2300 <hi>Evening-Morning, ver.</hi> 14. it is ſignified, the leſſer portions of Time are taken out of that great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; Again, As they are One Evening and One Morning, it ſpeaks the Time, One continued Evening, with a bright Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the end of it; As they are <hi>twenty three hundred E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening-Morning,</hi> it ſignifies ſo many Nights and Days, or natural <hi>Nycthemers,</hi> or prophetical <hi>Years,</hi> in which the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of darkneſs</hi> take the Evenings, or Night, under the Moon, and the <hi>Children of Light</hi> have the Mornings, or Dayes, for their portion, under the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> with which the <hi>Church is cloath'd,</hi> and hath the <hi>Moon,</hi> even when it ſeems moſt to have the Aſcendent, under its Feet; but their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or Day does not appear in its Brightneſs, till All night's paſt, and the <hi>bright Morning-Star</hi> ſhall appear.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:41903:58"/>
                  <p> The whole Maſs of Time, I ſay then, or the <hi>Time, Times, Half Time,</hi> is diſtributed into <hi>twelve hundred ſixty dayes,</hi> twice nam'd, but can be but one and the ſame Twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty; and <hi>twice forty two months,</hi> which, taken as Lunar Time, and ſingle, cannot be equal to Twelve hundred ſixty dayes, or ſo much Solar Time, and taken double, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds it, and therefore muſt, as hath been ſaid, and ſhall be prov'd, coaleſce, and knit one into another, as a due Point, and ſo may be Two forty two Months, and this, as proper to the Children of the Night, muſt be peculiar to the Beaſts Tyranny; and the Days diſtinct to the Children of Light, and their Holy Martyry, or Teſtimony, though under Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Death it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe, or the <hi>Tyranny of the Beaſt,</hi> is expreſſed by <hi>changing Laws</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> and <hi>wearing out the Saints of the moſt High,</hi> by <hi>accompliſhing to ſcatter the power of the Holy People,</hi> by the <hi>Gentiles treading the Court,</hi> and the <hi>Holy City under foot,</hi> whereby the <hi>Tammith,</hi> viz. the <hi>daily,</hi> or <hi>continual Publick Service</hi> of God is taken away, by <hi>making War with the Witneſſes and Saints, the Womans Seed,</hi> and <hi>overcoming,</hi> and <hi>killing them,</hi> as may be ſeen by a compare of <hi>Dan.</hi> c. 7. c. 8. c. 11. c. 12. and <hi>Apocal.</hi> c. 11. c. 12. c. 13.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond State of Things, or the Sufferings of the Church and Servants of God, is expreſſed by <hi>the Witneſſes,</hi> and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God <hi>worn out, given into the Hand</hi> of the <hi>little Horn,</hi> or <hi>Beaſt,</hi> (for he is call'd both, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. v. 8. 12. 25. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd) <hi>lying dead, caſt down, ſtamped upon, ſcattered,</hi> the <hi>Witneſſes in Sackcloth,</hi> and <hi>the Woman in the Wilderneſs,</hi> ſo as to be <hi>hid from the Face of the Serpent.</hi> All which appears in the places fore-cited.</p>
                  <p>Now that we may ſee, how theſe States, and ſo the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Time are Implex'd, and Enfolded one within the other;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the <hi>Time, Times, Half Time,</hi> are the common Womb and Continent of the whole Time; And this Character is therefore given firſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 25. And that it might be the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41903:59"/> more obſervable, it is given again the ſecond time, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 7. And then to give a farther notice to it, it is given a third time in the Revelation, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. 14.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe the juſt ſpace and duration of <hi>time, times, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi time,</hi> cannot be concluded certainly by themſelves, they are ſlid into <hi>twelve hundred ſixty dayes,</hi> lying, as I have ſaid, in the Boſome of <hi>twelve hundred ninety dayes,</hi> as the juſt ſize, and exact ſtandard of the whole Time, ſo that in its utmoſt Extent, It, and all its Characters muſt be equal; and they can neither exceed, nor fall ſhort of Twelve hundred ſixty Prophetical Days, or Years, that is, neither the Time, Times, Semi, or Half Time, nor the three Dayes and a half, which are but other words, as we ſhall ſee, for the Three Times and a Half; Nor the twice Forty two Months can be either longer or ſhorter than the Twelve hundred ſixty Years; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe therefore Fourty two Months of Lunar Time (as they ought to be interpreted, as hath been ſhewn) are not equal to twelve hundred ſixty Days, or Years; and that twice For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Months will much more exceed, therefore the Forty two Months, twice given, muſt be two Forty two Months, which, by the Characters we ſhall be guided to, we ſhall find at an exact Point, coaleſcing, or uniting into One, as hath been already ſaid.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe <hi>Time, Times, Semi Time,</hi> are both as long, and as broad as the <hi>twelve hundred and ſixty dayes,</hi> and yet have a more pregnant Intimate part, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Seaſon</hi> within the <hi>Time,</hi> in regard of which, or as referring to that <hi>Seaſon,</hi> they are call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or <hi>Seaſons,</hi> We ſhall find the States ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that Character, <hi>viz.</hi> Time within Time, or to <hi>Seaſon,</hi> which is a more pregnant intimate Time within a larger Time; ſo that they may both fill the Character at its utmoſt breadth and length, of Twelve hundred ſixty Years, and twice Forty two Months, and yet more fruitfully Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it with <hi>Seaſon,</hi> within its more intimate ſpace; Every part therefore of this Character, <hi>time, times, ſemi-time,</hi> hath the full extent of Twelve hundred and ſixty dayes, and yet

And that we may be led to this Obſervation, not only the words, <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Seaſons, half a Seaſon,</hi> but thoſe other words in place of them, <hi>viz. three dayes and a half,</hi> are on purpoſe choſen, as we ſhall ſee, when we compare the States, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Beaſts Tyranny, and the Churches Sufferings, with each Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Time, which I come next to do in the Third Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>

                  <p>THat the States of the Beaſts Tyranny, and the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es <note place="margin">Third General.</note> Sufferings, may then be beheld at nearer Lights, in their Implication with the Characters of Time, Let us in the next place Remark each Character of Time, match'd with its State, and the Order wherein the Characters are given, and then collect their certain Enfoldedneſs within one another, and how juſtly inferrible the Sameneſs and Oneneſs of the whole ſpace is, although given under ſo many various Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, in the Union of the States; Each of which hath yet its ſingular Uſe: For they are not vain Repetitions, or mere Flouriſhes of Symbolical Prophecy, but each Character, and each Repetition of each Character, hath its great particular Service.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, after the Real <hi>Line of Time</hi> given, as it were in Subſtance, in four Succeſſive <hi>Monarchies,</hi> and thoſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in an <hi>Image,</hi> or <hi>Immenſe Statue, Dan.</hi> 2. and then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Iconiſme</hi> of <hi>four Beaſts, Dan.</hi> 7.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41903:60"/> He, as the Proprietor, or Leſſee of them from God, is to be underſtood: For <hi>changing Laws and Times,</hi> and <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out the Saints of the moſt High,</hi> are ſo long given into his Hand.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, becauſe any fixed Limits of Time could not be known by <hi>Time, Times, Semi Time,</hi> being Hieroglyphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and a Number Vague, and Floating in the vaſt Compaſs of four <hi>Monarchies;</hi> There is therefore a Third Viſion, in which the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy, as having no farther Place in Time, is cut off altogether, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For it had been accounted in a Former Scripture-Line of Time, <hi>viz.</hi> the 390, and forty five <hi>Days for Years, Ezeck.</hi> 4. 5, 6. And therefore if it had not been cut off, when a new Line of Time was to be given; it muſt needs have diſturbed that Line, and all Account by it. The <hi>Perſian</hi> therefore, the <hi>Grecian,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchies are given in new Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, and a Line of <hi>twenty three hundred Even.

                  <p>And ſtill to ſhew the principal drift of Prophecy, at the <hi>Little Horn;</hi> it is firſt particularly, and notably pourtraied in <hi>Antiochus,</hi> as a Type, and therefore call'd, <hi>a Little Horn,</hi> and his principal Action is recorded to be the <hi>taking away the daily;</hi> For ſo I tranſlate it exactly according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Verity, the Divine Spirit ſeeming to have deſign'd a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the ſupplying the Senſe, either with Sacrifice before the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or with Service, or daily Worſhip af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Chriſt,</hi> according to the Rules of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> And it is Remarkable, except in this Place, and its parallels, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. there is not any Example of <hi>Tammith,</hi> or the Continual, without the Addition of Sacrifice; ſo that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſuppoſe it ſo plac'd for an eſpecial ſignificancy.</p>
                  <p>Now for the ſake of <hi>Taking away the Daily,</hi> the Viſion is call'd, <hi>the Viſion of the Daily,</hi> even as in regard of the 2300 <hi>Even. Morn.</hi> It is called the <hi>Viſion of the Evening and of the</hi>

                     <hi>Morning;</hi> although it is moſt evident, the Viſion contains much more matter, than juſt of the Daily taken away, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Perſian Monarchy,</hi> and the former parts of the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> and the 2300 Even.

                  <p>For, by reaſon of the length of a Line of Twenty three hundred Years, ſeeing no particular Time can be aſcertain'd by it; Therefore the next <hi>Viſions,</hi> either explicitely in the 70 <hi>weeks of years, viz.</hi> 490 till the end of the <hi>half Week,</hi> or three years and a half after <hi>Meſſiah</hi> cut off, and in the 1335, in which the <hi>Antitypical, Antichriſtian taking away of the Dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> begins, and endures theſe very 1260 <hi>Days,</hi> which we are upon, or implicitly, <hi>viz.</hi> 75 years, during the <hi>Words going forth to reſtore and build Jeruſalem,</hi> firſt by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> (though immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately interrupted by <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> and <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> till the ſecond of <hi>Darius)</hi> then by the ſame <hi>Darius,</hi> and after him, by <hi>Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes,</hi> called <hi>Longimanus,</hi> completed.

                  <p>All theſe things being ſo fix'd, that they cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for a Time there muſt be for the <hi>word going forth,</hi> by a full Evidence of Sacred Prophecy in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and Hiſtory in <hi>Ezra, Nehemiah,</hi> and <hi>Eſther,</hi> and this Time is fairly reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into 75 years, and then the 490 years of the 70 Weeks, agreed by all Chriſtians, after which, the 1335 muſt needs be, and they muſt be the laſt of the 2300. So there is onely ſpace for 400 neceſſary, which during the <hi>Seals opening</hi> until the <hi>Trumpets ſounding, viz.</hi> from three years and a half, or the laſt half week, ſo long after the Reſurrection, to the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Year of our Lord, 437. when the Weſtern <hi>Empire</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Valentinian,</hi> the Son of <hi>Placidia,</hi> began to be violently ſhaken by the <hi>Wind of the Trumpets,</hi> and its Flouriſh blaſted by the <hi>Fire and Hail</hi> of the firſt Trumpet mingled with Blood, by the agreement of all Hiſtory, was four hundred years. By all which Account, we muſt needs be in or about the Twelve hundred and fiftieth year of thoſe dark <hi>Twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty,</hi> and no more of them then about Ten remain, when Chriſtianity ſhall grow much brighter and clearer, till the <hi>full cleanſing of the Sanctuary,</hi> or the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> at 1772.</p>
                  <p>Let us now then proceed to the <hi>Apocalyptical</hi> Account of this <hi>Line,</hi> and the firſt Note of the Time is the <hi>Forty two Months,</hi> and that is firſt given, that it might exactly touch the taking away the Daily.</p>
                  <p>For whereas the Prieſts of Jeſus Chriſt, even all his pure Worſhippers, were to come into the Outward Court, the Type of Publick Evangelical Worſhip, or Spiritual Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and to fill it, and his Kings, under his Univerſal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Monarchy were to Reign; They were all ſeal'd up into a Beginning Retirement immediately after the Chriſtian Empire of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and the deſolation of Heatheniſm by him; in ſignification, that that perfectly <hi>cleans'd Sanctuary,</hi> nor that Kingdom ſhould not yet appear in Glory, but at
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41903:61"/> the <hi>firſt Trumpet,</hi> the Paganiz'd Antichriſtians crowded in under the very Title of Chriſts Prieſts, or Servants, and ſo took away <hi>the Daily,</hi> and prepar'd the way to the Beaſts ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal of the Kingdom, upon which the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> put on <hi>Sack-cloth,</hi> and the <hi>Woman,</hi> or Church, <hi>fled into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Forty two months,</hi> and the <hi>twelve hundred ſixty dayes</hi> began together, at the <hi>daily taking away,</hi> as that Divine Perſon, Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>the man in linnen,</hi> had declared to the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 12. and <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>And whereas there is in <hi>Daniel</hi> no mention of the <hi>Forty two months of the Gentiles,</hi> nor of <hi>the Beaſts forty two months,</hi> which we ſhall be to conſider in this <hi>Line</hi> alſo, it is with admirable contrivance of the Divine Prophetick Spirit; For in as much as the <hi>Time, Times, Semi-Time,</hi> are ſo appropriated to the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> as that they are never alienated from his Action, and the Servants of God ſuffering under him, and are as deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive of him as the very Name, <hi>Beaſt;</hi> for Times in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are as deſcriptive of Perſons and Things as Names; as we all know, what is meant by our laſt 41, or 71, apply'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Perſons or Things; Further, in that <hi>Seaſon, Seaſons, Half-Seaſon,</hi> are abſolutely proper to the Beaſt; and that yet they reſpect principally the intimate part Time, of which hath been ſpoken; therefore <hi>Time, Times, Half Time,</hi> could not be attributed to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or the <hi>other</hi> Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. For that had been an Entrenchment upon the <hi>Grand Beaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet becauſe the <hi>Beaſts time of duration,</hi> much more of his Regnancy, was not ſo early as the Twelve hundred ſixty dayes, begun in the Sufferings of the Servants of God, and that the Daily Service is no where ſaid to be taken away by him, but rather <hi>from him,</hi> or <hi>before him,</hi> and as in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to <note place="margin">

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. The whole of this Line, and of the laſt <hi>ſeventy five Years,</hi> is meaſured by even <hi>Indictions,</hi> or Fifteens of Years; the uſe of which Riſing in the Reign of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> became well known by the beginning of this Line, which is one great Confirmation, that we are upon the true Time of it; for to declare this, as it were with Induſtry, there are <hi>even thirty</hi> joyn'd to the 1260, and more openly Three Fifteens, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Five to the 1290, that we may thereby be engag'd to look back upon the whole Line, and find it throughout ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted, as may be eaſily computed, and hath been before obſerv'd on <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Viſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Each Community hath its juſt ſhare in the intimate and full extended Time of this Line, and each twice given: The Beaſt hath firſt his intimate Time, twice given in <hi>Daniel;</hi> and by two <hi>forty two months,</hi> given firſt to <hi>his Gentiles,</hi> till his own riſing, and then forty two Months to himſelf; he hath the utmoſt extent of <hi>Time, Times, half time,</hi> as before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and drawn out of the 2300 Evenings: In juſt corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with which, the Servants of God, as collected and congregated in the Woman, the Church, that they might not be accuſed as having Relation to no Church; and ſingle in the Witneſſes, and the Seed, who have the <hi>Witneſs,</hi> that <note place="margin">

                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:41903:64"/> the Church might not ſeem a Notion onely, have each one and the ſame 1260 <hi>da.</hi> drawn out of the 2300 <hi>mornings</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to them; and the Witneſſes <hi>three dayes and a half,</hi> and the Woman <hi>three times and a half,</hi> or <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> or inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Time, anſwering the Beaſts intimate Time, who muſt have the Servants of God as a ſubject to work upon while his Tyranny laſts.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Time at large, or the Twice 1260 Days, muſt needs be the ſame, and differ only in notion, as the Church, and the Witneſſes, or the <hi>Seed</hi> that have the <hi>Witneſs of Jeſus</hi> do, is moſt evident; becauſe lying within the ſame Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of <hi>Time, Times, Semi Time,</hi> and being both of the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reach, and exactly of the ſame ſize, it is not poſſible they ſhould begin or end ſooner one than another, as we have found it poſſible the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and the <hi>Beaſts months</hi> may do; For neither are they ſo united as the <hi>Woman</hi> and the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes;</hi> And their <hi>months,</hi> though of the ſame ſize one with another, are yet not of an equal extent to <hi>time, times, half time,</hi> at their full length; nor to the 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> the juſt meaſure of the <hi>three times and half;</hi> although both the <hi>Forty two months</hi> uniting, as we have ſaid, are neither long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er nor ſhorter than the 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> nor than the <hi>Three Times</hi> and <hi>half,</hi> the common Womb of all.</p>
                  <p>And even ſo the <hi>three Times and half of the Woman,</hi> and the <hi>three dayes and half of the Witneſſes</hi> muſt be the ſame alſo, ſeeing the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> and the <hi>Woman</hi> are the ſame, and the 1260 <hi>dayes</hi> the ſame, and no difference, but only notional, as was explain'd. For if they were different, the <hi>Woman</hi> ſhould have no parallel to the <hi>three dayes and half</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> nor the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> have any parallel with the <hi>three times and half</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> which, as moſt unbecoming ſo Uniform a Type, are impoſſible alſo in ſuch a ſameneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Marches, or Out-lying Borders, as well as the Intimate Time are full, on the ſide of both Communities, the Beaſts Tyranny, and the Sufferings of the Servants of God.</p>

                  <p>But now their Years were ſo neceſſarily Solar Years, for there can indeed be no Year but ſtrictly Solar, that they moſt induſtriouſly provided to Adequate their Lunar Time to their Solar; by <hi>Intercalations,</hi> and Inſerted <hi>Months,</hi> or a double <hi>Adar,</hi> which was their laſt Month of the Year; we every Leap-Year by a double Twenty Eighth of <hi>February;</hi> As may be ſeen by the Learned, in that Excellent Tract of <hi>Maimonides</hi> of <hi>Intercalations;</hi> which gives great light to this whole <hi>Matter:</hi> As ſhall be farther taken notice of in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Management of this Diſcourſe.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>We need not ſo much mind combating Parties in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by names hateful or reproachful to them; much leſs thoſe little ſnatches at them by trifling Reflections upon them; let us center our ſelves upon Truth it ſelf, in the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41903:66"/> word of God, and <hi>grow in Grace and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and that will ſecure us from this <hi>Error of the Wicked,</hi> and from <hi>falling from our own ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastneſs;</hi> this will <hi>cut off Offence</hi> from all but thoſe, who are reſolved to <hi>take Offence;</hi> this will preſerve us in due regard to Authority, if we diſſent from it, in matters of Religion; and yet we ſhall preſerve our Religion, while we keep cloſe to thoſe <hi>Images</hi> of things, Scripture hath given us, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe notes of Time it hath fitted to them, and ſuffer Hiſtory, which is every mans Priviledge to read, to hear, or to know, even by the Law of Nature, to declare what fell out; and this we cannot be deny'd, ſince God hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed us in all things, and commands us to ſearch his word, and to <hi>hear and read the Words of his Propheſie,</hi> and <hi>count the numbers</hi> he hath given, with <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstanding;</hi> and his Miniſters are to expound to us, and then we are to <hi>ſearch</hi> and <hi>try</hi> whether <hi>thoſe things are ſo or not;</hi> and in all things receiv'd from the word of God we know, and all know, it is more reaſonable <hi>to obey God than Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are two things, in which the Happineſs and Welfare of Man conſiſts, for this World, and for that to come; both which he hath made, as certain and evident to us, as the Light.</p>
                  <p>One, and the Firſt, and Principal, is <hi>true Religion,</hi> fix'd in his Word, with the preſent Conſent of Natural Conſcience, and the Awes of that, even whether we will or no. If we would but reſt in the clear, plain, and undoubted Truths of it, and not be haſty of removing from them, till we have full Evidence from them to conduct us farther into Divine Knowledge, without ſuffering our own Fancy to miſlead us, or our Credulity and ſudden Belief of others, to hurry us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Impoſitions.</p>
                  <p>The Second is <hi>Loyalty,</hi> or <hi>Subjection</hi> to the <hi>Sovereign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> ſet over us by God, and what that is, we may eaſily know; For the Sword of Juſtice is Supremely in the Hands of it, and the Government of that World in which we live,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41903:67"/> that the Diſorders of Mankind may not ſwallow up it ſelf, depends upon it; It carries before it a <hi>Terrour to evil works,</hi> and a <hi>praiſe to them that do well;</hi> Upon which account we <hi>muſt be ſubject, not only for wrath, but for Conſcience ſake.</hi> And when this is in the Hand of a Prince, whoſe Anceſtors have been Princes throughout many Ages, when the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is Clear and Lineal; we can have no greater Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>The Power that is, is ordain'd of God;</hi> And ſuch, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, is the Caſe of our Nation, that we can have no poſſible Scruple.</p>
                  <p>Now our Subjection is clear, what it ought to be, even in all things, but our Religion, whether Reveal'd or Natural, for <hi>that is Gods;</hi> and to be rendered to him onely; All things elſe are <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s. A Chriſtian, as a Chriſtian, can have no Scruple or Doubt in any thing elſe, whatever it be; This he can by no means ſubmit; It is to impeach Sovereignty in its higheſt Orb, even as it is to obey a Subordinate Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, <hi>ſent by the King,</hi> againſt the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Supremacy.</hi> But in all things elſe, he needs as a Chriſtian <hi>ask no Queſtion for Conſcience ſake.</hi> What men may, as men, as the Subjects of ſuch Laws, ſuch Eſtabliſhments, as every Nation hath pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to it ſelf, inſiſt upon, I leave to thoſe Laws. I know as Chriſtians, the <hi>rendering</hi> our Lives, our Eſtates, if call'd for by God, and the Edicts of Princes, cannot hurt our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, but <hi>rendering</hi> our Religion to any but God and his Word, will.</p>
                  <p>So theſe two things, Religion and Loyalty, can never claſh, can never interfere; for to deny the ſurrender of our Religion, can never hurt our Loyalty; for to be Religious according to the Word of God onely, and Natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence guided by that, is the higheſt Loyalty: This is all the Loyalty Man can require; to <hi>render</hi> All things elſe without <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> and to <hi>Love, Honour, Pray</hi> for the Prince that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires all; our Loſs God will <hi>recompence in the Reſurrection of the Juſt.</hi> So a Chriſtian hath no need to be Diſloyal, if he underſtand his Religion aright: It is not our Loyalty to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41903:67"/> our Prince, to be of our Prince's Religion, though it be right, it is our Loyalty to God in the firſt place; ſo it is not Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty not to be of the Princes Religion, if it be not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Word of God, when we render All but our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, He can require; And this we need not fear to do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot loſe by it, our Reward will be great from our <hi>Father, who is in Heaven;</hi> and as Chriſtians we ſhould be aſham'd to deny it; but in Religion, even to the leaſt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of it, except determined by natural decency or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, we have but <hi>one Father</hi> and <hi>Maſter, God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> and here he hath neither <hi>Vicar,</hi> nor <hi>Vice-gerent,</hi> but his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in his Word.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould be content in this time of the <hi>Apostaſie,</hi> with a <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Remark </seg>3</label> mean Condition upon the account of Religion, not to ſeek Grandeur and Honour upon that Title; If God caſts it on us, we ſhould improve it to his Glory and the ſupport of the Service, and Servants of Chriſt, it is the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that carry the Pomp and Greatneſs of this World in a Religious Equipage; it is even a ſuſpition upon what is high, and ſtately, and in Opulency by Chriſtianity; for Chriſts <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> are in <hi>Sack-cloch,</hi> it is the Time of the <hi>Delay of his Kingdom,</hi> and all his Servants are with him in the <hi>Patience</hi> of it; they ought not to raviſh Glory, and ſurpriſe Dignity before the time, but to ſtay for it, till the <hi>appearance of Jeſus Christ, the</hi> 1260 <hi>Days of Mourning,</hi> and of the <hi>Church in the Wilderneſs</hi> are not yet run out, the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is yet in Power; the <hi>Tenthlineſs of the City is not yet fallen, the Kingdom of Chriſt is not yet proclaimed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is no wonder, there is yet ſo great a Rent and Diviſion <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Remark </seg>4</label> in Chriſtian Religion, that any thing unreaſonable, or a frame of things moſt contrary to it, bears up againſt all the urgencies of Scripture and Reaſon, and will not be bafled nor aſhamed; but vouches high, and pretends aloft; <hi>ſo it ſhould</hi> be, that <hi>Propheſie may be fulfilled,</hi> The <hi>Beast</hi> and his Adherents are obſtinate to the laſt, even when the Elevation of things againſt them ſhall be much higher then now, when

                  <p>But within a Time, a ſhort Time it will be decided; it will come to that publick Declaration of the <hi>Witneſſes Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> of <hi>their Song before the Throne,</hi> the poſitive Denunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, If any man <hi>worſhip the Beast,</hi> and <hi>his Image, He ſhall drink of the wrath of God, and &amp;c,</hi> will put an end to all Diſpute, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 9.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, let not any pretence ſtagger us, <hi>The man of ſin ought to ſit in the Temple of God;</hi> his ſeat then muſt be founded in a profeſſion of the true Religion; his Antiquity ſignifies nothing; for he ought to be <hi>a Beast of forty two months of years, or above twelve hundred years standing.</hi> His Pretences from any thing ſaid or done before that 1260, how early ſoever, if it be not found evident in Scripture, is of no avail; for the Myſtery of Iniquity, the Womb out of which He came, was at work, and in a Myſtery ſo ſecret, ſo cunning, as not to be diſcern'd by many good men; and all to bring him to what he was, and is; the Spirit of Antichriſt was then in the World.</p>
                  <p>It is no wonder Princes continue ſo devoted to him, and his <hi>City,</hi> he calls a <hi>Church;</hi> the <hi>words</hi> of God are not yet <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled</hi> concerning him, but they ſhall conſider, and <hi>change their Minds when God puts it into their Hearts;</hi> and therefore we ought earneſtly to <hi>pray for them,</hi> whatever their Perſwaſions are now; that God would continue their Lives, for they ſhall then be Inſtruments in his hand; that change ſo near approaching ſhall be moſt orderly, moſt regularly by Princes themſelves induced by Evidences from Heaven, of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary nature; God will not be help'd herein, but by <hi>his own Vicegerents,</hi> whom he hath appointed, whom he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd; no Sedition, Rebellion, may grow from hence; It is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41903:68"/> to be quieted, appeas'd, and even rooted up by this Doctrine, even as it is utterly condem'd by it, for God will appear, and Princes with him.</p>
                  <p>But yet on this, nor on any other Account, can there be a Reconciliation, a Compoſition with this falſe ſtate of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: there may be ſuch Attempts, for there will be a <hi>Synagogue of Satan</hi> riſing a-new at the very approach of Chriſt's Kingdom, before the end yet of the 1260 Days: It appears as if there would be ſo; for <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> the beſt State of the Chriſtian Church before the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> and with which it united, ſhall receive Acknowledgment from ſuch a <hi>Synagogue,</hi> that Chriſt hath lov'd it. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
                  <p>But this Repreſentation of <hi>Beſtianiſm,</hi> obſtinate, impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the Laſt in the Body of it, as it is the deciſive Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and beyond all Volumes of Diſpute, becauſe it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, perpendicular, down-right, ſwift, and ſudden in its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination; ſo it ſhews the impoſſibility of meeting half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, accepting Terms to any good Effect.</p>
                  <p>We know not what may be between this preſent Time, though but a Remnant, and the end of the 1260 Days. There may be an Eye of the <hi>Witneſſes kill'd,</hi> and lying dead, <hi>three days and a half,</hi> a return of former Darkneſs in ſome parts at leaſt: I apprehend it not in this Nation; yet <hi>God only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi> it is not ſo far reveal'd, ſo far as I have found; but I hope not: There may be <hi>a Synagogue of Satan;</hi> a Project of Compounding; this I more fear: but let us obtain and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a full Victory over the Image, <hi>the Mark, the Name, and the Number of the Name.</hi> But it is certain, it is but <hi>ten prophetical Days,</hi> and the Witneſſes ſhall not only every where riſe, but every where come out of <hi>their Sackcloath,</hi> out of which, the <hi>true Witneſſes of God</hi> are no where yet come: Then they ſhall, <hi>for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So many certain Notes, Characters, and Boundaries of Time as I have drawn together in the compute of this Line of Time with it ſelf, and that are given as Aſſiſtants to it,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41903:69"/> though not immediately of the Eſſence and Body of it; can be no more by chance than many Pictures exactly reſembling ſeveral Perſons pertaining to a Family, and found in the Manſion of ſuch a Family, and at ſuch Times when ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were known to be ſo appertaining to it, can be by chance: Forc'd they are not; for things themſelves conſpire: Fancyful and Arbitrary they are not; for they cannot be chang'd, or remov'd at Pleaſure, nor any like them made.</p>
                  <p>If then they are truly Scriptural and Divine, How cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſhall they be fulfilled in their Seaſon? All counter-Appearances can ſignifie no more, than the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſeverer Uſage by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> argued againſt their Deliverance by <hi>Moſes.</hi> All the Diſaffection in the Age to Interpretation of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or its inſenſibleneſs of them, can no more diſprove them than Chriſt's coming as a Thief upon <hi>Sardis</hi> at an <hi>Hour</hi> it knew not, ſhall be diſprov'd by the Sleepineſs and Unwatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of <hi>that Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us then with Reſolution, Conſtancy of <hi>Obedience,</hi> Strength of <hi>Faith, Labour of Love, Patience of Hope, wait for,</hi> and <hi>come to the end of theſe ten days,</hi> and from them to the 1335 Days, where Bleſſedneſs ſhall certainly be.</p>

                  <p>I anſwer; The Saints of God living on Earth ſhall receive their ſhare in all the Glories of his Kingdom, and the ſeveral degrees of it: and they that dye, <hi>hoping, waiting, deſiring, praying,</hi> ſhall be rais'd in the very ſame poſture of Soul wherein they died: ſo that they, who by a general Faith and Obedience <hi>waited,</hi> and <hi>came</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Time, and ever ſince, <hi>viz.</hi> by earneſt Prayers, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, Come quickly,</hi> ſhall be <hi>bleſſed;</hi> even as they who by particular <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> wait, and come at the Time it ſelf.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Why ſhould it be thought an <hi>incredible thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> that God <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Remark </seg>6</label> ſhould draw in his Word the Plot of Future Time to ſo great a Period as the Kingdom of Chriſt? That all Futurity is within the Graſp of Infinite Omniſcience, cannot be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Known to God are all his Works from the beginning to the end.</hi> The Scheme of all that hath been, before it was, or that ſhall be, is always with Him, as if it juſt now was, in all the circumſtances and Life of a preſent Appearance, in whoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, All preſent, paſt, to come, are all one. The whole Table of Time is always before Him.</p>
                  <p>Does it then pertain to the Prerogative of Omniſcience, that Future Things ſhould be known only to himſelf? It does ſo indeed, any further than he is pleas'd to reveal them. But He that challenges the falſe Divinities of the Heathen, that they could not <hi>declare things to come,</hi> hath certainly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">Iſa. 42. 23.</note> Inſtances of his own Preſcience, and Demonſtrations of it to his People. Hath he not done ſo in all Ages, by his Servants the Prophets? Is he not as Liberal to the Ages of Chriſtianity, to the ſtate of things under the Goſpel <hi>of his Son,</hi> whom he hath conſtituted <hi>Heir of all things,</hi> and <hi>put in ſubjection to him the World to come, of which we ſpeak.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or, is the Glory of Divine Truth ſo great, that even as immediate Appearances, the Power of Miracles, and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Revelations have ceas'd ſince the full Settlement and Sealing the Volume of Truth in the Goſpel, ſo Prophecy needs not now. This indeed hath much of Reaſon, yet even
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41903:70"/> as all Truth is compriz'd in that Volume, ſo are the Grand Revolutions pertaining to the Chriſtian Church, in the ſame Volume; and therefore whatever God hath done for the former World, the very ſame hath he ſumm'd up in the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>When therefore we have, beſides the Interſperſion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy in ſeveral places of it, a Book wholly Dedicated to Prophecy, <hi>Bleſſed is he that heareth and readeth the words of this Prophecy;</hi> Have we not reaſon then to expect the courſe of things to the very end in it?</p>
                  <p>But does not the Prophecy it ſelf ſay, The Things were ſhortly to come to paſs? So that what is to be found in it pertain'd to the primitive Age, the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the Time when Chriſtianity was well ſettled, and till Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>Rome</hi> became Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, The Divine <hi>Revelator, Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> does ſay, the <hi>things were ſhortly to come to paſs,</hi> that is, to begin to come to paſs. They were then upon motion; but as a great Army is ſaid to come immediately, when the Avant-Corriers are coming, or come, although the whole Body and Rear may be conſiderable diſtances off, ſo this whole Series, and Chain of Events in the <hi>Revelation come quickly,</hi> although the firſt and the laſt part differ ſo many Ages. Is it not clear and viſible, that there is the Beginning of Things, and the End of Things in every mans Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion plain and evident, that is, from the Reſurrection, and to the Day of Judgment? and why then ſhould we not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, there is the Middle of Things alſo? Why ſhould we imagine, Prophecy hath made ſuch a Leap over the Between Lying Times, ſeeing they were very great? Did it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove his Church and Servants to know of ſo great, and wide ſpreading an Impoſture as <hi>Mahometaniſme?</hi> Was it nothing to it, Chriſtianity ſhould be in ſo low and dark a ſtate, as it was from the loweſt Fall of the Weſtern Empire to the Ruine of the Eaſtern Empire, in both which the principal Reſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it were; and ſo long ſpace as from 666, to 1453.</p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:41903:70"/>
                  <p> But ſtill, it may be ſaid, If ſuch a Prophecy be, it does not become us to <hi>pry</hi> into it; it is the <hi>Ark of ſecret things, that do not belong to us.</hi> Why then does Chriſt ſay, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that heareth the words of this Prophecy?</hi> Why doth he command him <hi>that hath Wiſdom and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, to count the Number of the Beaſt?</hi> Why doth He, in explication of the Seven Heads ſay, <hi>Here is the Mind that hath Wiſdom?</hi> Why had Chriſt the Revelation <hi>to ſhew to his Servants?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But was it not all one, as if they had not been reveal'd, ſince the Revelation was not pretended to be underſtood in former Times? I anſwer, we do not know what was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> ſo cover'd and muffled all Things, and does yet ſo darken them; The univerſal prejudice againſt the Explanation of this <hi>Prophecy</hi> is, I doubt not, the effects of this <hi>Apoſtaſie:</hi> But that there hath gone a ſtream of Light from hence to the Servants of Chriſt, by <hi>the Witneſſes</hi> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Age, is to me out of all queſtion, and that it hath diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the Things moſt neceſſary to that Age, although the Light hath been not only clearer, but the knowledge that ſuch a Light hath been, more certain to us ſince the laſt Age and Half, and ſhall be every day clearer and clearer.</p>
                  <p>When therefore there are ſo many Types ſo very propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to Events, ſo agreeable to the Notes of Time, and even ſo ſcituated in the Courſe and Series of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> except that in ſome Chapters, as 11, 12, 13, 17, 21, there are on great occaſions Recollections, and yet even thoſe, in order to going on, as I have abandantly ſhewn; I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, why theſe things, and their Explications ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo ſtrange and unreaſonable to us.</p>
                  <p>But however, the Glory of God, and of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be unſpeakably Great, when the whole Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his Kingdom delay'd ſhall be drawn out of what he had ſo curiouſly depainted in the <hi>Prophecy of the beloved Daniel,</hi> and <hi>the Apocalypſe</hi> of the beloved Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> and with Admiration and Raviſhment His Servants ſhall behold the one in the other.</p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:41903:71"/>
                  <p> Let all this perſwade us, to have kinder, and more benign Inclinations to the Interpretation of this <hi>Prophecy;</hi> which, if we are the true Servants, and Lovers of Chriſts Kingdom, we have no reaſon to fear: only the Apoſtaſie, and Enemies of it, have reaſon to fear it.

                     <hi>A more particular Allocation, or juſt placing of the</hi> States <hi>and</hi> Times <hi>one to another, ſhewing the neceſſity of their enfolded Equality to, and with one another.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Have thus far in a more general view of the Particulars of this Line, preſented the compute of the Times, and of each of their Characters, with the correſpondent States: I will now more amply and particularly remonſtrate upon the States, and ſo adjuſt them to the Times, and their Characters, as may fully evince their cloſe Connexion, and the abſolute and moſt neceſſary equality of all the States and Characters of this Line, one to and with another.</p>
                  <p>And that we may plainly have together, and under one Glance, that which hath been ſpoken of, and is farther to be ſpoken of and made good, I thus delineate it.</p>
                  <p>The States are the <hi>Beaſts</hi> Tyranny, and the Sufferings of the Servants of God under it; diſtinguiſh'd by various live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Remarks.</p>
                  <p>The Characters are thoſe Notes of Time God hath affix'd to, and determin'd upon theſe States, making up one Line of Continuance, or Duration of thoſe States.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the States and the Characters, are thus to be ſuited one to the other.</p>
                  <p>There is one common Continent, or Womb of Time, that incloſes each State, and all the Characters of Time given to each State, that is, <hi>Time, Times, half a Time,</hi> with <hi>three days</hi> and <hi>a half,</hi> declaring Time at large, and intimate Time, or <hi>Seaſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is one equal Standard-Line, making certain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite the ſpace of that common Continent, taken out of the 2300 Ev. Morn, <hi>viz.</hi> 1260 going on to 1290. The State fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it is the <hi>taking away of the Daily,</hi> Dan. 12. <hi>v.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:41903:72"/>
                  <p> Intimate Time taken out of that common Continent is twice given on the Beaſt's ſide, <hi>viz. Seaſon, Seaſons, Half Seaſon.</hi> The States fitted to each are <hi>wearing out the Saints of the moſt High, changing Times and Laws given into his hand,</hi> Dan. 7. 25. <hi>ſcattering the Power of the holy People,</hi> Dan. 12. 7. doing all theſe to the utmoſt, or accompliſhing to do them in the higheſt degree.</p>
                  <p>The ſame intimate Time is twice given to the Servants of God alſo; <hi>viz. Three days</hi> and <hi>half</hi> to the <hi>Witneſſes.</hi> The State fitted to it is to be kill'd, and to lye dead, but not to be <hi>ſuffer'd</hi> to be <hi>buried</hi> or extinguiſh'd, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 7, 8, 9. and <hi>three Times</hi> and <hi>a half to the Woman,</hi> whoſe State fitted to it is to be ſo in the Wilderneſs, as to be hid from the Face of the Serpent, but yet to be <hi>nouriſhed, Rev.</hi> 12. 14.</p>
                  <p>The Time at large is twice aſſign'd on the <hi>Beaſts</hi> part, Forty two Months taken out of the 2300 Even. or Nights, <hi>given to the Gentiles.</hi> The State fitted to them is <hi>treading the outward Court,</hi> and <hi>Holy City,</hi> whereby the <hi>Daily</hi> is <hi>taken away,</hi> at the very Beginning of the 1260, lying in 1290, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 11. compar'd with <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 2, 3. The ſecond Time <hi>Forty two Months to the Beast</hi> himſelf, Doing all he does to the laſt Continuance or Accompliſhment to the laſt Moment, is the State fitted to them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 5. and both theſe Forty two Months twiſt into one Space, equal to 1260 Days.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Time at large is twice adjuſted to the Servants of God in twelve hundred ſixty Days, taken out of the 2300 <hi>Morn.</hi> or <hi>Days;</hi> once to the <hi>Witneſſes;</hi> and the State fitted to it is <hi>Prophecy in Sackcloth,</hi> yet with great Vertues and Powers reſident in them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. and once to the <hi>Woman</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> yet as in a Place <hi>prepared by God,</hi> where <hi>they ſhould feed her, Revel.</hi> 12. 6. And theſe two 1260 Days are perfectly both one, neither longer nor ſhorter than themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Between the Time at large, and Intimate Time, or <hi>Seaſon,</hi> there is a Pillar erected to ſhew where <hi>Seaſon</hi> begins, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41903:72"/> by proportion where it ends, <hi>viz. The Beaſts Number, as Lord of the intimate Time eſpecially,</hi> and it is 666, from its Root 25, after the Reſurrection, to 725; and the State of it is, <hi>That no man may buy or ſell that hath not the Mark, or Name on his Right-hand, or on his Fore-head,</hi> or the <hi>Name,</hi> or the <hi>Number of the Name,</hi> nor ſo much as <hi>live</hi> if he doth not <hi>worſhip the Image.</hi> The end of which intimate Time is by Proportion 1517, and ſo on, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 15. to the end.</p>
                  <p>But now beſides this meaſure of intimate Time, becauſe the Beaſt is Lord of <hi>Time, Times, Half a Time,</hi> and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by God, his <hi>Forty two Months</hi> are an exact Meaſure alſo of the whole Line, beginning at that moſt famous Epoch, ſo well known to Hiſtory, the Ceſſation of the <hi>Weſtern Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> 475, whence his <hi>Forty two Months,</hi> to be ſet as Lunar Time to the 1260 <hi>Days</hi> of Solar Time, muſt be 1222, and ſo beginning at 475, muſt end at 1697, with the 1260 <hi>Days</hi> beginning 437, thirty eight Years before them with the <hi>Gentiles Forty two Months;</hi> according to the Laws of this Line of Time, and of the Sun's and Moon's Motion, collated one with another.</p>
                  <p>And to confirm the right Calculation of this whole Time to us, <hi>Imperial</hi> Time is adjuſted to it by the Emblems of the falling <hi>Empire in the West,</hi> till the vulgar 606, when <hi>the Beast,</hi> as <hi>a Star falling to the Earth,</hi> enlightned that <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire, ſo darkned before, that neither <hi>Sun,</hi> nor <hi>Moon,</hi> or <hi>Stars, ſhined in its third part,</hi> and preſently after aroſe the <hi>Mahometan Hegira,</hi> or Account of Time at 626; the which Imperial Time is accounted till the <hi>Fall of the Eaſtern Empire,</hi> under the ſame Emblem of the <hi>third part of Men,</hi> which alſo is to be cleared: within ſeventy Years of which, intimate Time ceaſes, and that Change we call the <hi>Reformation</hi> enſu'd at 1517, repreſented by its moſt ſignificant Emblems, and the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Power ſtill continued, and yet is to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to the end of the whole Line 1260, which goes to 1290, and ſo to 1335, the happy end of all the 2300 Ev. Morn. All which I cannot but hope will be acknowledg'd a rational and clear Account of this admirable Line.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:41903:73"/>
                  <p> Now of every of theſe particulars, I undertake particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to diſcourſe; and although, I confeſs the Order of Nature is firſt to ſpeak of the Kernel of Time, or the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Time, to which the Fore-going Time at large is but a Preparation, and After-Time but an Accompliſhment; yet becauſe I muſt follow, as the Divine Spirit hath gone before, I begin with the Ambient Time of <hi>the Gentiles Forty two Months,</hi> and of the <hi>Witneſſes twelve hundred ſixty Days in Sack-cloth,</hi> and of <hi>the Woman in the Wilderneſs,</hi> that firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and are plac'd as in Complex one with another, before the Inner Time, or <hi>Seaſon.</hi> In beginning with which, Sacred Prophecy is pleas'd to make the way plainer to us.</p>
                  <p>To begin then firſt with <hi>the Gentiles, Treading the Holy Court and City,</hi> which, as hath been declared, does not run as a principal Character, but at fartheſt, to the firſt part of the intimate State, or Seaſon, and there is ſupported by the latter <hi>Forty two Months of the Beaſt</hi> to the very end of the whole 1260 <hi>dayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the knowledge of this either State or Character of Time, is peculiarly given by the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> and hath no other Intimation in <hi>Daniel,</hi> than what is common to the <hi>Time, Times, Semi-Time,</hi> and to the <hi>Twelve hundred ſixty,</hi> joyn'd with the <hi>Thirty more,</hi> and ſo making <hi>Twelve hundred ninety,</hi> at the <hi>taking away the Daily,</hi> and yet, becauſe it is of very great Uſe and Neceſſity in this Account of Time, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is given ſo diſtinct and expreſs in this excellent <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyptick</hi> Prophecy, which ſurpaſſes <hi>Daniel,</hi> even as the New <hi>Testament</hi> exceeds the Old, and as <hi>Revelation,</hi> however my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, excells Type, and Figure of an older date.</p>
                  <p>Now the great Uſe of this Character is this, When the Beaſt does neither in the Account of Prophecy, nor Accord of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, riſe, till ſome years after the <hi>Twelve hundred ſixty years</hi> began, nor reach his State eſpecially deſign'd to be ſet out by <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophecy, till many years after the 1260 <hi>years</hi> began, <hi>viz.</hi> the very beginning of his moſt intimate State, at his ſo often mentioned 666, in previſion of which, it is ſaid, <hi>The</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41903:73"/> 
                     <hi>Saints, Times and Laws are given into his hand, Seaſon, Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>

                     <hi>and half a Seaſon,</hi> meaning this intimate Time. Upon all this, it may well be ask'd, How came the <hi>Daily</hi> to be <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> ſo early <hi>away?</hi> what is the occaſion of the <hi>Witneſſes put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on Sack-cloth,</hi> or the <hi>Womans flying into the wilderneſs,</hi> ſeeing all theſe belong to the <hi>Beaſts</hi> Tyranny, who did not yet exiſt, nor till ſo long after appear'd Regnant, or why are the <hi>Twelve hundred ſixty days</hi> made to begin ſo much ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than the <hi>Beaſts Forty two months?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in Anſwer to this, The <hi>Gentiles treading under foot the holy Court and City,</hi> appears timely, to give cauſe to all theſe things; and to ſhew the Agreement of Prophecy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with it ſelf; Theſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> are no other, than they, that are ſaid, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. to <hi>dwell on the Earth, whoſe Names are not written from the foundation of the world in the Lambs Book of Life,</hi> whom that <gap reason="foreign">

(of whoſe <hi>two Horns like a Lamb</hi> was ſpoken before, and who is hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter further to be explain'd) inſtructed to worſhip the Grand <hi>Apocalyptick Beaſt,</hi> as one with the <hi>Pagan Roman Empire</hi> in its Idolatrous Univerſality, call'd therefore the <hi>Firſt Beaſt,</hi> and to make an Image to it, <hi>viz.</hi> an Image unto its Idolatry, and to its Monarchy; which Things are hereafter to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd upon the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> but at preſent it is eaſie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.

                  <p>For thus, according to <hi>Daniel,</hi> All theſe things were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiating for the <hi>Beast,</hi> who was the Prince deſign'd, and on whom all redounded in the Iſſue, and theſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>other Beaſt</hi> were to be his Subjects, and the other <hi>Beast</hi> his <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi> zealous of him and of his worſhip, and ſo the <hi>Daily</hi> worſhip was <hi>Taken away</hi> from before him, or out of his way, the way of his Riſing, as <hi>Daniel</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told.</p>
                  <p>And thus, according to the <hi>Revel. the Gentiles tread the Holy Court,</hi> and <hi>the Witneſſes put on Sack-cloth upon it,</hi> and the <hi>Woman</hi> flyes into the Wilderneſs; for what theſe <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> do, they do by the Conduct of that <hi>other Beaſt,</hi> who from his <hi>Lamb-like Horns, yet ſpake as a Dragon,</hi> in reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Pagan <hi>Dragon,</hi> while they convey his Power to the <hi>Grand Beast</hi> of the <hi>Seventh Head.</hi>

                  <p> I confeſs, it may ſeem, the <hi>Church</hi> is ſooner in the <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> than the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are in <hi>Sackcloth;</hi> for aſſoon as the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man brought forth the Man-child, it was caught up to the Throne of God;</hi> which <hi>Bringing forth and Enthroning</hi> was certainly when the Empire became <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> and that was long before 437, when the <hi>Witneſſes put on Sackcloth,</hi> as I aſſert.</p>
                  <p>But to clear this, it is to be conſider'd, there are three ſynchronous Deſcriptions of the very Beginning of this Line of Time, or of the <hi>Apoſtacy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is bottom'd upon the ſubſtantial and ſenſible Foundations of Imperial Hiſtory, under prophetick Figures; <hi>viz.</hi> Of the blaſted <hi>Western Empire,</hi> embelliſh'd with very curious Types of the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> then beginning, as ſhall be ſhewn upon the <hi>first Trumpet ſounding,</hi> when we come to it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is by the more Scriptural Images of the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes putting on Sackcloth,</hi> on account of the <hi>Gentiles treading the Holy City, or Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the third by the parallel Shade of the <hi>Woman flying into the Wilderneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Firſt hath a plain diſtinct Indication of things prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Apoſtate State, in the Declaration of a new Roll of Martyrs, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</note> in the <hi>ſealing</hi> the 144000 Sufferings after the Chriſtian Empire, in the <hi>Silence in Heaven for only half an Hour,</hi> in the <hi>Angels preparing to ſound;</hi> all which were ſo many diſtinct Steps towards the Apoſtacy. This is the moſt full and clear.</p>
                  <p>The Second hath one like it, in <hi>the Reed given to John,</hi> with a Command <hi>to meaſure the Temple,</hi> which was parallel and contemporary to the <hi>Sealing,</hi> by all Rules of Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as we ſhall ſee.</p>
                  <p>The Third is, the <hi>Womans flying into the Wilderneſs;</hi> where indeed there is no open mention of a Preparation, but the Event is given in one view, <hi>viz. The Woman flying into the Wilderneſs;</hi> yet in that the Woman having been firſt ſpoken
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41903:77"/> of, her Hiſtory, as to the utmoſt extended Time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, is given together; ſo, as to make it evident, the ſo ſudden Aſſignation of the 1260 Days in the Wilderneſs is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven both to match the Preparation of the two former Types to the <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> as alſo to joyn the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and the <hi>Womans twelve hundred ſixty Days</hi> into one; and the true Order both of that Preparation and Vergency, as alſo of the 1260 Days beginning is given in the ſecond giving of the Womans Times and Half Time, as ſhall be made moſt clear, when we come to parallel theſe three ſynchronous Deſcriptions in their Events at the <hi>First Trumpet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as to the Involution of theſe Three States, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, as neceſſarily contemporizing one with another, it is even ſelf-demonſtrative: for when the <hi>Daily Service of God</hi> is <hi>taken away,</hi> and the <hi>Beſtian Gentiles</hi> delay the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt in Preparation <hi>to the Antichriſtian Prince;</hi> the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> muſt, if there be ſuch a prophetick Type, <hi>prophecy in Sackcloth,</hi> and retire to the <hi>Altar of Incenſe,</hi> as to private Worſhip: and if the <hi>Woman</hi> be the ſame with the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> or <hi>her Seed;</hi> if They are hid in Sackcloth, and there be ſuch a Type as of her ſelf <hi>in the Wilderneſs</hi> fed with hidden Manna; how can both be, but at the ſame Time? And if the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> be in <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> and the <hi>VVoman in the VVilderneſs,</hi> and there be ſuch a Type as <hi>of the Gentiles treading the Holy Court,</hi> That, and That only, being then in view (the <hi>Beast</hi> being not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen) muſt be the occaſion of it: And if there be ſuch a Type as <hi>Sealing,</hi> which ſignifies Secrecy, Retirement, and Delay, the efficacy of that muſt be at the ſame Time with the parallel Symbols: for this ought to be a Standard throughout; The <hi>Gentiles</hi> and the <hi>Beast</hi> cauſing the Sufferings of God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and the Servants of God, the Sufferers muſt in all things parallel one another, according to the Degrees of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for the Action of the one neceſſarily produces Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the State of the other receives Sufferings, as neceſſarily; ſo their ſeveral Symbols require there muſt be the Efficients to work; there muſt be the Subjects to work upon, Both at the ſame Time.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:41903:77"/>
                  <p> There are yet two Symbols more, Tangents, or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately joyn'd with the beginning of this Line, that come in to our Aſſiſtance; and they are the <hi>true Worſhippers,</hi> retiring within the <hi>Temple,</hi> enfolded with the <hi>Gentiles entring</hi> the <hi>outer Court,</hi> and the <hi>Servants</hi> of God under the efficacy of their <hi>Seal,</hi> at the <hi>firſt Trumpet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That we may make all things then moſt clear, with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this Epoch, let us more diſtinctly compare all the Symbols of this Prophecy, that immediately touch it, and pierce as far as we can into their ſenſe and meaning, and joyn therewith that their immediate Touch of this Epoch: For if by all theſe we can well fix it, it is an abſolute, and undoubted foundation of the whole Time.</p>
                  <p>Now there are four Symbols, all meeting to begin this Time, upon each of which, we may either Recollect the Subſtance of what hath been already ſpoken upon any of them, or dilate our Thoughts upon what in any of them hath not yet been explain'd, and ſee how any Intimations, or Notes of Compare among themſelves reflect Light from one to another.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which comes firſt in the order of the Prophecy, as alſo in order of nature, is, the <hi>ſealing the hundred forty four thouſand,</hi> into a Secreſie and cloſe Retirement; For a <hi>Seal</hi> on their <hi>Foreheads,</hi> and the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Lambs Father written on their Foreheads,</hi> differ, as a Writing ſeal'd, and a Title open, and in Capital Letters; compare <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 1. &amp;c. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 1. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Temple,</hi> the <hi>Altar,</hi> and the <hi>Worſhippers therein,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd within cloſe, and confin'd <hi>meaſures,</hi> is the next given Symbol. And here it is neceſſary to inquire, what is meant by the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the <hi>Altar,</hi> becauſe <hi>the Temple</hi> ſometimes is taken for the whole <hi>Area</hi> or ground, upon which it ſelf, and all its Courts and Avenues ſtood, yea, even the whole City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was reputed a Court to it, and the <hi>Holy City</hi> thereupon we find it ſtyl'd. But the <hi>Temple</hi> at other times is taken ſtrictly for that retyr'd part of it that was under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41903:78"/> and into which the <hi>Prieſts</hi> only came; There were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo two <hi>Altars,</hi> one in the Outer Court, which was the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of Burnt-offering</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> in approach to which the Congregation came: and the <hi>Altar of Incenſe</hi> within the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> to which the <hi>Prieſts</hi> only drew near, and the <hi>People ſtood without. Luke</hi> 1. 9, 10. 2. 22.</p>
                  <p>Now it may be a Doubt, what <hi>Temple,</hi> and what <hi>Altar</hi> are here intended, and the deciding of the <hi>Altar</hi> will much contribute to the deciding of the <hi>Temple;</hi> And that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of Incenſe is alone intended, and the Inward Cover'd <hi>Temple,</hi> in which it ſtood, before the <hi>Vail,</hi> or the <hi>Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> theſe three things do enough aſſure us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Altar of Incenſe</hi> is brought into view and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, juſt before this Time, of the <hi>meaſuring the Temple,</hi> (as ſhall be prov'd) and in diſtinction from that <hi>Altar,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the <hi>Souls</hi> lay as <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> compare <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>ca.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 5. &amp;c: as it were to intimate, that the <hi>Daily</hi> Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip, under the Type of <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> was near its <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away,</hi> and the private cloſe Worſhip at the Altar of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe ſucceeding, and within the Temple, with both which the <hi>ſilence</hi> agrees.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Cry</hi> for the <hi>looſing the four Angels, bound in Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> ſounds from this <hi>Golden Altar of Incenſe,</hi> whither the True Worſhippers had been long retir'd before the Time of that Cry, and were cloſe within the <hi>Temple. c.</hi> 9. 13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The very Symbol it ſelf ſpeaks an inwardeſt Retirement within the <hi>Temple,</hi> and to the <hi>Altar</hi> encloſed within that; For whatſoever was outward, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Outward Court</hi> and <hi>City,</hi> was <hi>caſt out to the Gentiles,</hi> who <hi>trode under foot the Sanctuary,</hi> and Holy place of Publick <hi>Sacrifice, viz.</hi> the <hi>Court,</hi> where the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and People had place, and ſo make up this Symbol: For the Gentiles having the <hi>Outward Court</hi> of Sacrifice under <hi>their Feet,</hi> the <hi>Daily</hi> Service became <hi>taken</hi> away; ſo the True Worſhippers retir'd to ſecret Service at the <hi>Altar of Incenſe,</hi> the <hi>Apocalyptick</hi> Type of <hi>Prayers, c.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third Symbol is the <hi>Witneſſes in Sackcloth,</hi> that, as hath been ſaid, is a mournful Habit, and covers that Glory
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41903:78"/> and Excellency wherewith they were endued by the great Powers committed to them; and their <hi>Prophecy</hi> imports a Delay of ſome admirable Things they declar'd, which till Twelve hundred ſixty dayes paſt could not come to paſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Woman in the wilderneſs,</hi> yet in a <hi>place prepared by God,</hi> where ſhe ſhall be <hi>Fed,</hi> as <hi>Elijah</hi> in the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> in a high and wonderful manner, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> c. 19. v. 5. 6. makes the fourth and laſt Symbol. <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 6. Now a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs condition is out of view, ſeemingly loſt and forlorn; the Church therefore in the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> fed like <hi>Elijah,</hi> cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the <hi>Church</hi> with the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> who are ſo eminently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to <hi>Elijah;</hi> and ſhews, they are the ſame in ſubſtance <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 6.</note> with the <hi>Woman,</hi> under onely the different Notions of ſingle, and collected, as was before explain'd.</p>
                  <p>Now all theſe Symbols are of neareſt Importance; for all ſpeak Inviſibility, Secreſie, and a State out of view and ſight, and which conceales its true Excellency within it ſelf; ſo does being <hi>Sealed,</hi> ſo does <hi>worſhipping</hi> at the <hi>Altar of Incenſe,</hi> and within the <hi>Temple,</hi> ſo does the <hi>Sackcloth</hi> of two ſo great <hi>Prophets,</hi> ſo does a <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Woman</hi> in the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> and all theſe are upon Perſonages of the ſame Character; For ſo are the <hi>Servants of God,</hi> ſo are the <hi>true worſhippers</hi> at the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar in the Temple,</hi> ſo are the <hi>Martyrs</hi> or <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> ſo is the <hi>Woman</hi> that <hi>brought forth the manly Child,</hi> and whoſe <hi>Seed keep the Commandments of God, and hold the Martyry or Teſtimony of Jeſus:</hi> And then all theſe we ſhall find cope, and bind with the Gentiles Months in ſome or other Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Point and Regard.</p>
                  <p>All theſe ſo cloſely coordinated Symbols, would of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much incline us to ſuppoſe, that they all begin toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially when two of them have the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Time, <hi>viz.</hi> 1260 <hi>d.</hi> But becauſe there can be no proof ſo great of the Beginning of theſe Twelve hundred ſixty dayes, nor of their whole, full, and entire length, and the ſeveral other Notes of Time that will fall in, each in their due place, as the <hi>Beaſts forty two months,</hi> His <hi>Number</hi> 666,

                  <p n="1">1. To apply to the <hi>ſealing,</hi> to <hi>the Altar of Incenſe,</hi> and <hi>the Temple-worſhipers,</hi> to <hi>the Witneſſes in Sack-cloth,</hi> and to the <hi>Woman in the Wilderneſs,</hi> the Notes of Hiſtory correſpondent to their Beginning, according to the Prophetical Symbols, and beginning together with the <hi>Gentiles forty two Months.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. By the ſame ſupports from <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> to paſs to the beginning of the <hi>five</hi> and <hi>five Months,</hi> and the ſpace of Time thereby denoted, granted <hi>to the Locuſts, Revel.</hi> 9. 5. 10.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Within which ſpace, the beginning of intimate Time, the reaſon of it, and its whole duration will fall under Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, and its 666, by Prophecy and Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p n="6">6. At the end of intimate Time, and after the <hi>killing the third part of men,</hi> we ſhall be brought upon the Time of the aforeſaid <hi>ſolemn Oath,</hi> that <hi>Time ſhall be no more,</hi> which will carry us to the end of this whole Line, and wind us up with

                  <p>All which, by the guidance of the Prophecy it ſelf, and the aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit of it will aſſure us by the moſt illuſtrious and ſtately products of that whole Time and of greateſt Concernment to the Chriſtian World, that theſe 1260 years are a moſt definite ſpace of ſo many, and no few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor more in number, and that ſeeing they muſt be either <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Prophetical</hi> Time, according to the Standard <hi>of a day for a year,</hi> for the Scripture-Regiſter knows no other ſort of Time, nor can any inſtance be given of any other, therefore they muſt be <hi>prophetical days,</hi> or <hi>days of years,</hi> and <hi>months of years,</hi> ſince the Events deſtin'd by God to them, are ſo much too great and large for natural Time in their own Nature, and in the prophetical deſcyphar, that no more, then a year can be a year, and yet be crowded up within a Month, a Day, or Hour; no more can thoſe long Tracts of Time-ſome Action be fettered within three years and a half, the higheſt amount of thoſe Characters of Time, if naturally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, without a Contradiction in the very Nature of things.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. How far the <hi>ſeven Seals</hi> had brought down Time from <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Enquiry </seg>1</label> our Lord's Reſurrection to the firſt of the <hi>ſeven Trumpets,</hi> muſt be diligently enquir'd and ſettled, ſeeing one follow on the other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Importance of the <hi>ſealing</hi> the <hi>Sevants of God</hi> after the <hi>ſeven Seals</hi> open'd, and the conſpiring of that Symbol with the Retirement of the <hi>Worſhippers within the Temple, the Witneſſes under Sackcloth,</hi> and <hi>the Woman into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> muſt be determin'd and ſettled; for the Sealing's Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy begins All, even the very Trumpets which could not ſound till the ſealing over.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Scope and Intention of the <hi>Trumpets</hi> is to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully eſtimated in the ſtrict Attention to the Emblem it ſelf; and ſeeing the firſt <hi>four</hi> and the <hi>ſixth</hi> diſplay upon <hi>third part of Men,</hi> what <hi>third part of Men</hi> it is they play upon, muſt be found: for the <hi>Trumpets</hi> play upon that Third of Men runs along the whole Line we are upon; and why all this Play upon a Chriſtian Empire?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It muſt be duely reſearch'd, what the Symbols of the <hi>three firſt Trumpets</hi> convey to our notice, to what Time Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory directs us, that we may find their Effects.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It muſt be juſtly ſtated, what the <hi>Dragon</hi> means, and how his <hi>Perſecution of the Woman</hi> can agree with the Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> ſeeing both muſt be at the beginning of the Line, becauſe then was the Womans firſt Flight into the Wilderneſs, which was at the firſt of the 1260 Days.</p>
                  <p>Now if all theſe can be rationally according to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and the Argument of Hiſtory reſolv'd, ſo as to unite
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41903:80"/> with the Gentiles forty two Months, and all of them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the beginning of this Line to be at the beginning of the <hi>Trumpets ſounding;</hi> and both to be at <hi>Ann. Dom.</hi> 437, and to reach in the <hi>three firſt Trumpets</hi> to the <hi>Beaſts</hi> riſing, at 475; then that will be done which ought to be done: for by neceſſary Conſequence, the Line muſt end at 1697.</p>
                  <p>I begin with the firſt; <hi>viz.</hi> to enquire, How far the <hi>ſeven Seals</hi> open'd had brought down Time from our <hi>Lord's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> to the firſt of the <hi>Trumpets ſounding:</hi> for the <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi> muſt needs follow upon the <hi>Seals,</hi> as is moſt apparent.</p>
                  <p>Now, ſince it is very evident, the <hi>Reſurrection of Christ</hi> begins the whole courſe of <hi>Apocalyptical</hi> Time, I know not what can be more demonſtrative of any point of Time, than to find the <hi>Prophecy</hi> by the moſt lively Pictures, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems to draw the courſe of Events from a Time given, as from the <hi>Reſurrection Ann. Dom,</hi> Vul. 33, to a Time given, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Trumpets ſuppos'd to be <hi>Ann. Dom.</hi> Vul. 437. that is from the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> the Apocalyptical Epoch or Time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning 404 Years.</p>
                  <p>Now what could more congruouſly, and even undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, follow the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> than Chriſt <hi>riding</hi> out in his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> in the univerſal preaching of the Goſpel by an <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Miniſtry, and thereby claiming his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom according to the firſt Seal opened?</p>
                  <p>What follows more uninterruptedly upon that than that warlike ſett of Emperours, and upon the <hi>red</hi> Horſe of War, arm'd with a great Sword given them; <hi>viz. Veſpaſian, Titus, Trajan, Hadrian,</hi> reſpecting eſpecially the Deſolations of the Jewiſh Nation, according to the Prophecy, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. <hi>ult.</hi> which was perfectly fulfill'd by the laſt of theſe nam'd Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, according to <hi>the ſecond Seal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Can any thing more juſtifiably follow this Train of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, than the grave, juſt, rational Succeſſion of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonines,</hi> or cloſe with greater Eſclatt and Renown than in <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> ſo fam'd for Juſtice, that the <hi>Ballances</hi> are moſt worthily put into his Hand, and <hi>by a Voice from</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:41903:81"/> 
                     <hi>the Throne in the midst</hi> of the Beaſts, the whole Scheme is directed upon the Church, and the Half-Time fix'd from the Reſurrection to the Apoſtacy or <hi>taking away the Daily Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God;</hi> under the Type of the <hi>Wheat, Barly, Oyl,</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> the Materials of Sacrifice, the Type of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Service;</hi> all which are the Reſult of the <hi>third Seal</hi> opened?</p>
                  <p>Who can deny, that a Chain of ſalvage Emperours preſs'd upon the Heels of <hi>Alexander,</hi> in whoſe Equipage, <hi>Famine, Peſtilence,</hi> the <hi>Sword</hi> attended, and was moſt fitly given with the Device of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> waiting upon the diſmal Pomp of theſe Beaſts of the Earth in the <hi>fourth Seal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it poſſible to overſee the Perſecution rais'd by <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> that ceaſed not by the ſpace of ten Years, in which all the Chriſtian Blood ſhed by the <hi>Pagan Emperour</hi> was ſumm'd up; Is it, I ſay, poſſible to overſee this in the <hi>fifth Seal,</hi> the Emblem of which is the <hi>Cry of the Souls under the Altar?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No more can it be denied, That that great Shake of the Power of the <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>the Air</hi> above, and of the <hi>Heathen Idolatrous Powers</hi> below, is admirably pourtrayed in the <hi>ſixth Seal</hi> opened.</p>
                  <p>After which, we find an induſtrious Delay to the <hi>ſeventh Seal</hi> in the <hi>new ſealing;</hi> and the <hi>ſeventh Seal,</hi> when opened, did moſt leiſurely produce the very <hi>ſounding of the Trumpets;</hi> for firſt, There was the <hi>ſilence of half an hour,</hi> a ſhort and imperfect Time indeed, but it ſtay'd the Effect of the <hi>Sealing;</hi> for not till that half Hour paſt, the <hi>Trumpets</hi> were deliver'd to the <hi>Angels.</hi> After that there was a ſolemn Service of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, ſignifying the <hi>daily Service</hi> yet continuing, and upon the Acceptance of it a ſecond demoliſhing of <hi>Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi> by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> Defeat of the laſt Rallyings of it; by <hi>Eugenius</hi> and <hi>Argobaſtis;</hi> after <hi>Julian</hi> and other Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izers upon his Prayers.</p>
                  <p>Now from that Time, or <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great's Death, within a Year after, at 395, or near it, all Hiſtory dates the Declination of the <hi>Weſtern Empire,</hi> and <hi>Prophecy</hi> agreeably
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41903:81"/> denotes the <hi>Angels preparing to ſound,</hi> in the many Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon the Empire by foreign Invaſions upon it, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiting the very date of their Sound from the Time <hi>Theodoſius</hi> died to 437, or 404 from the Reſurrection, ſomewhat above forty Years, but according to the Half time exactly before obſerv'd, at <hi>Alexander Severus</hi>'s death, <hi>An. Vulg.</hi> 237, or 202, from the <hi>general Epoch, the Reſurrection,</hi> with this half 404.</p>
                  <p>Let us now Review the wonderful Conſent and Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny between the Relation of Hiſtory in Things ſo undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to be incumbred with no Controverſie, and the Schemes of this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> the one keeping hand in hand with the other, in ſuch an even, uninterrupted, and juſt ſuceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and courſe of Time, as does abundantly prove this Line, and its Beginning, ſo far as is neceſſary in this firſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, to be at 437, and conſequently its End at 1697: All which have been more fully Treated, and are here only ſumm'd up, to make the Perſpective the clearer and more entire.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the Second Enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi> into the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Enquiry </seg>2</label> of the <hi>Sealing;</hi> wherein theſe two things will deſerve our particular Examination.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What the moſt natural and ready ſignifications of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling are, and which is here to be choſen, as moſt agreeable with the other Symbols of the Worſhippers Retir'd into the Secret of the Temple, the Witneſſes Sackcloth, the Woman in the Wilderneſs, upon the Gentiles Treading the Outer Court.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the Efficacy of this Sealing began; for that leads the Time of the Trumpets, even as the Trumpets fix the Time of the <hi>Sealings</hi> Efficacy.</p>
                  <p>As to the Firſt; it is to be known, that Sealing imports three things;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Secrecy, and Retirement from general and ordinary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. Thus the Servants of God, by the Antichriſtian, Apoſtatical Times coming on, are hidden; no eye but the eye of God, or of men inlightned by him, could diſcern
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41903:82"/> all of them: The Diſguiſe put upon them by <hi>Antichriſtians caſting them out for Gods name ſake,</hi> their Retiring from the common corruption of <hi>Publick Worſhip,</hi> their <hi>mourning</hi> for the <hi>Gentiliſme</hi> brought in, and the Kingdom of Chriſt not appearing, their not being ſuffered to meet as a <hi>Church,</hi> a Body, or Congregation of Saints, and the Glory of God and Chriſt not ſhining out yet upon them, brought them into the Secreſie of <hi>a ſealed</hi> condition, immur'd them within the <hi>Temple,</hi> and at the <hi>Altar of Incenſe,</hi> cas'd them in <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> and <hi>ſcatter'd</hi> them as into <hi>a Wilderneſs;</hi> ſo that at length the <hi>Serpent</hi> himſelf could not find them; and all this from the beginning of the firſt Trumpets ſound, at 437, till 1697, more or leſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Sealing</hi> intends Security and Preſervation; Thus Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are ſealed up in Safety, and defended from violation and rapine; thus the Servants of God are ſafeguarded by their <hi>Sealing,</hi> the <hi>Temple</hi> being the <hi>Secret</hi> of <hi>Gods Preſence,</hi> their <hi>Sackcloth Prophecy</hi> arm'd them, as by vertue of the <hi>Sealing,</hi> with a mighty power of Miracles, and <hi>Fire going out of their Mouths to deſtroy their Adverſaries;</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> even in the Wilderneſs, is depoſited in a <hi>place prepared by God</hi> for her, that ſhe might be <hi>fed:</hi> and all to this purpoſe, That they might, though they might ſuffer in the common Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the ſeveral Trumpets, yet not be <hi>hurt</hi> in their true Eſſential Glory by the Dragon, but that they ſhall <hi>Reign</hi> when He is <hi>Bound;</hi> nor ſo <hi>ſhut up,</hi> but that the <hi>Temple</hi> ſhall be <hi>opened,</hi> &amp;c. nor be ſo overcome by the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> but that they ſhall <hi>Riſe</hi> again, <hi>aſcend to Heaven in a Cloud, their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies beholding them with terrour,</hi> and appear in <hi>Mount Zion</hi> with the <hi>Name of God written</hi> in <hi>legible Characters</hi> on their <hi>Foreheads,</hi> and at laſt, in an innumerable company, cloath'd in white Robes, and Palmes in their Hands, and the Church it ſelf, as the <hi>Bride,</hi> the <hi>Lambs Wife,</hi> be admirably Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Moſt immediately, and cloſe to the purpoſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Symboll, <hi>Sealing</hi> ſpeaks Delay, and Eſtoppage from a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41903:82"/> preſent Expoſal or publick Shew. And thus the Symbol of <hi>ſealing</hi> is provided to claſpe and indent with the former Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of the Seals; for the whole Symbol is taken from <hi>ſealing</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> of Chriſt's Kingdom, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 4. till the end: when therefore at the <hi>ſixth Seal opened,</hi> the Empire became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, the <hi>manly Birth was caught up to the Throne of God,</hi> the <hi>Dragon</hi> was <hi>cast down,</hi> and a Song of Victory ſung up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, immediately this <hi>ſealing</hi> followed to ſtay this Glory, and as it were to arreſt its Appearance: it was therefore hid from hurt, becauſe the Glory did not appear to be hurt, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>time, times, half a time,</hi> according to the <hi>Oath</hi> of Chriſt; immediately therefore, in purſuance of the former Symbol, the <hi>Servants of God are ſeal'd,</hi> the <hi>Worſhippers</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip not in an open, but reſerv'd <hi>Temple;</hi> the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> do not enjoy, but <hi>prophecy,</hi> and that in <hi>Sackcloth;</hi> the <hi>Woman flies</hi> to her cloſe Receptacle in the <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> and even in purſuance of this ſame Symbol, the <hi>ſeven thunders</hi> are <hi>ſeal'd,</hi> as we ſhall ſee, <hi>Cap.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>And all this to that very purpoſe, that the <hi>Beast</hi> may have his <hi>time, times,</hi> till the Morning of the <hi>half-time,</hi> when in Declaration of the Right of Chriſt, even then to take the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> becauſe the <hi>half-time was entred,</hi> as the <hi>third Day</hi> was in the <hi>Morning</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Reſurrection,</hi> the Thunders began. But that the <hi>Beast</hi> might have his whole <hi>half-time</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, the <hi>Thunders</hi> were again <hi>ſeal'd down.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For were not the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> thus under <hi>Seal,</hi> its <hi>Brightneſs</hi> would immediately <hi>conſume the man of Sin</hi> and his <hi>Beſtian Kingdom,</hi> as will be ſeen at the end of the 1260 Days, <hi>viz. Ann.</hi> 1697, in the firſt appearance of Chriſt's Kingdom, and more fully at the Appearance it ſelf 75 Years after.</p>
                  <p>Let us now inquire when this <hi>ſealing</hi> had its Efficacy, and we ſhall find it hath its Efficacy diſtinguiſhingly, as to the fixing its Epoch, or Beginning, at the firſt of the <hi>first Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> and ſo on, during the whole Time of the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Trumpets,</hi> until the <hi>falling of the Star</hi> in the <hi>third Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet;</hi>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:41903:83"/> So that the <hi>Trumpets</hi> and the <hi>ſealing</hi> neceſſarily begin together, as they ought.</p>
                  <p>For we find it is thus expreſly determin'd to the firſt of the <hi>firſt two Trumpets;</hi> for nothing that was <hi>hurt</hi> in thoſe <hi>two firſt</hi> Trumpets, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> nor the <hi>Sea,</hi> nor any <hi>Tree,</hi> was to be <hi>hurt</hi> till the ſealing paſt: And why was it ſo? but that the <hi>Seal</hi> might have its defenſive Vertue on the <hi>ſealed;</hi> which Defence was certainly as early as the <hi>hurt,</hi> elſe it could not defend. It is expreſly continu'd all the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet</hi> by naming the <hi>Earth, Sea,</hi> and <hi>Trees;</hi> for all theſe were hurt in the <hi>two firſt Trumpets.</hi> But the <hi>Fountains</hi> are not nam'd, nor the <hi>Sun, &amp;c.</hi> not becauſe the ſealing did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue; for we find the expreſs mention of it, riſing within the Time of the <hi>firſt woe Trumpet, Revel.</hi> 9. 4. as of a thing ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have continued all along.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe the Spirit of God would lead us to the new date of Time, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Beaſts forty two Months,</hi> negotiated by the event of the <hi>third Trumpet,</hi> or <hi>the Imperial Star fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> which <hi>Star,</hi> as all Hiſtory knows, <hi>fell</hi> at 475, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately on which, the <hi>Beast</hi> in <hi>prophetical</hi> Account ſucceeded, as the <hi>eighth King.</hi> So that then, in the very ſpace of the <hi>third Trumpet</hi> thoſe <hi>Months</hi> began, and the <hi>fourth Trumpet</hi> ran upon that new Line of the <hi>forty two Months,</hi> concurrent with the 1260 <hi>Days,</hi> and ſo forward, till Both end at 1697: the one as Time of the Moon, or <hi>Months;</hi> the other as Time of the Sun, or <hi>Days:</hi> by which we know alſo when the 1260 <hi>days</hi> began; <hi>viz.</hi> by computing and adjuſting the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar Time of <hi>forty two months</hi> to the Solar Time 1260 <hi>days.</hi> If the <hi>months</hi> began ſo famouſly at 475, The <hi>days,</hi> that both may end together within <hi>time, times, half a time,</hi> muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin thirty eight Years before, or at 437, as hath been before intimated, ſo as to be plainly underſtood, but ſhall be fully proved.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe of all this, the Spirit of God comprehends only what pertain'd to the <hi>firſt two Trumpets</hi> within the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſecurity of not being <hi>hurt; viz.</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Trees</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:41903:83"/> of the <hi>firſt Trumpet,</hi> and the <hi>Sea of the ſecond Trumpet,</hi> till the <hi>Servants of God were ſeal'd, Revel.</hi> 7. 2, 3. ſhewing plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that then the Efficacy of the <hi>ſealing</hi> began: where firſt, the <hi>Earth,</hi> and all <hi>green things</hi> were <hi>hurt</hi> in the <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>the Sea in the ſecond Trumpet,</hi> and as it were, to hint the <hi>Beaſts forty two months,</hi> falling within the <hi>third Trumpet,</hi> and ſo going on in the <hi>fourth;</hi> There is no mention of the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Fountains,</hi> nor <hi>the Lights of Heaven,</hi> until the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God</hi> were <hi>ſeal'd;</hi> which the Beaſt could not yet ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate for, being in his Infancy till a <hi>Star fell to the Earth, Revel.</hi> 9. 1. which, by all Count, was at the Time <hi>Phocas</hi> gave Univerſality to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Rome</hi> ſeems to be again enlightned, not long before the <hi>Mahometan Hegire,</hi> when the <hi>Locuſts</hi> came forth; and therefore then Divine Judgment purſues by <hi>three woe Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,</hi> becauſe then the ſurpriſe of the Kingdom of Chriſt, by the cheat of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> reigning, more appear'd.</p>
                  <p>But after another concurrent date of Time, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Five,</hi> and <hi>five Months</hi> of the <hi>Locuſts, Revel.</hi> 9. 15. 10. given new in the <hi>fifth Trumpet,</hi> the <hi>ſealing</hi> is there mention'd again; and in the <hi>ſixth Trumpet,</hi> where the <hi>Hour, Day, Month,</hi> and <hi>Year</hi> of the <hi>Horſemen</hi> began, there is a parallel Symbol of Secreſie and Security with the <hi>ſealing, viz.</hi> the <hi>true Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers crying</hi> out from the <hi>Altar of Incenſe,</hi> where they were hid, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9. 13. within the firſt of which, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts,</hi> fell in the <hi>Beaſts</hi> intimate Time, or <hi>Seaſon,</hi> with his <hi>Number</hi> 666, as ſhall be ſhewn, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, by all theſe the Spirit of God does interpoint and diſtinguiſh the beginning of the Lines of ſeveral Times, that fall in with the great entire Line of the 1260 <hi>Days;</hi> and notes when they began; which new Lines, do ſome way or other note when that great Line began, and when it ſhall end; <hi>viz.</hi> by the Proportion thoſe other Lines, however be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning after, hold to it; all joyning with it, when they are once begun: and by that Proportion, The Beginning muſt be 437, and the end of it 1697, as ſhall be ſhewn upon all of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41903:84"/> them. Wherein alſo the Time remark'd with the Voices of the <hi>ſeven Thunders ſeal'd,</hi> will admirably ſhew it ſelf at 1517, when the laſt 180 Years, or Half-time, began; at which Time the Diviſion of ſo many States from <hi>Rome</hi> firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd alſo. And the End of all at 1697, will declare it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>So ſtrongly, although requiring ſtrict Attention and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, hath God ſecur'd the fixing of this Line, both in its Beginning and End, as ſhall be all along by Gods graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous permiſſion to proceed, made evident.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall but juſt ſalute the Third Enquiry, and finiſh the firſt Point diſcours'd, <hi>viz.</hi> its Beginning: And becauſe it joyns in aſſuring this Beginning, I muſt, as I ſay, ſalute it.</p>
                  <p>And this Third Enquiry is to Reſearch what is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Enquiry </seg>3</label> of this Grand <hi>Apocalyptical Symbol,</hi> the <hi>Trumpets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now from the general Uſe, and univerſal Signification of a <hi>Trumpet,</hi> as an Alarm to War, and the diſmal conſequences of it, theſe Trumpets certainly ſignifie the ſame, as appears by the courſe of the <hi>Trumpets;</hi> for every <hi>Trumpet</hi> calls to ſome War, and the <hi>ſeventh</hi> to the <hi>Battel</hi> of <hi>Armageddon;</hi> They are therefore ſo many loud Sounds of the Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God upon thoſe againſt whom the Sounds are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>two firſt Trumpets</hi> then, as beginning at 437, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the <hi>Barbarian Nations</hi> to fall on, on all parts of the Empire, as they had began to do, by the vertue of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels preparing themſelves to ſound.</hi> About this time, <hi>Genſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus</hi> the <hi>Vandal-King</hi> took <hi>Carthage,</hi> the <hi>Hunns</hi> over-ran the upper and lower <hi>Pannonia,</hi> (now called <hi>Hungary) Thrace,</hi> and <hi>Illyricum;</hi> the <hi>Brittiſh Provinces</hi> ſoon after fell into the Hands of Strangers and <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Thus the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Greenneſs, the Flouriſh and Verdure of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> was univerſally blaſted by the <hi>Hail</hi> and <hi>Fire min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Blood</hi> of the <hi>first Trumpet,</hi> running every way. At the ſame time, no <hi>Green</hi> of true <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> was unblaſted by the Apoſtacy, and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, as a <hi>great Mountain bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:41903:84"/> 
                     <hi>with Fire,</hi> was <hi>thrown into the Sea,</hi> that is, it had been indeed taken under <hi>Honorius,</hi> in the preparation to <hi>Sound,</hi> and immediately recover'd: But now, at the <hi>Second Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> it was made the Ball of War, in a continual Taking and Retaking for many years after; ſo that the Flames of War from ſeveral Parts of the World, and the People of it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to <hi>a Sea,</hi> congregated about it, and in the midſt of the fearful Broil, the <hi>Imperial Starr, Auguſtulus,</hi> the laſt Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, fell.</p>
                  <p>From hence therefore we obtain the clear Agreement of Time with the Symbol of the <hi>Firſt three Trumpets,</hi> as their Blaſt fell upon the <hi>third part of men,</hi> the Figure of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire,</hi> in Agreement with the <hi>Dragon,</hi> or <hi>Roman Emperours drawing down the third part of the Starrs with his Tayl.</hi> Revel. 12. 14. Where all Interpreters underſtand that <hi>Imperial Power.</hi> Now at the very time of the <hi>Barbarous</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, coming like the <hi>Gentiles</hi> into the chief Reſidences of the Chriſtian Religion, is the Symbol of the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles, treading the Holy City and Court,</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi>

                  <p>But that the Miniſtration of the <hi>Trumpets</hi> may anſwer the Miniſtration by the Servants of God in his Church, at the <hi>Seals</hi> opened; beſides this Semblance of the <hi>Trumpets</hi> with War, Holy Writing leads us to another, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sacred uſe of Trumpets in the giving of the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. And they were inſtituted by God to call the Congregation of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God together, which was now not into Publick, but in Private at the <hi>Altar of Incenſe;</hi> There was alſo the <hi>Feaſt of Trumpets,</hi> on the <hi>Firſt Day</hi> of the <hi>Seventh Month,</hi> joyn'd with the <hi>Reading of that Law,</hi> upon which follow'd the <hi>Solemn Faſt,</hi> on the Tenth Day, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 23, &amp;c. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 29. 2. Thus by theſe <hi>Trumpets,</hi> the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> began their <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony</hi> for the <hi>Commandments of God,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine of Jeſus,</hi> and in <hi>Sackcloth</hi> and <hi>Faſting.</hi> Theſe <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Watchmen</hi> blew the <hi>Trumpet</hi> according to the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41903:85"/> charge laid upon them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 32. v. 1, &amp;c. And according to this <hi>Blowing the trumpets,</hi> the <hi>Camp,</hi> the <hi>Congregation,</hi> the <hi>Woman</hi> the Church, made its motions in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. v. 1, &amp;c. So admirably does this Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol agree with the <hi>Gentiles forty two Months of treading the Holy Court,</hi> with the <hi>Worſhippers at the Altar of Incenſe,</hi> with the <hi>Witneſſes Prophecy in Sackcloth,</hi> and the <hi>Womans Flight into the Wilderneſs,</hi> as <hi>on Eagles wings,</hi> in regard of Divine Providence, as well as of the <hi>Roman Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Empire Apoſtatizing.</p>
                  <p>And how fitly does the whole <hi>Apocalyptical</hi> Time an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the <hi>Jews Feaſt of the Paſſover</hi> at the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt, united with the <hi>Feaſt of Weeks,</hi> at the <hi>giving of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>John's being in the Spirit</hi> when he receiv'd the <hi>Revelation:</hi> and then follows the Interval of the <hi>Seals</hi> opened, like that Interval of <hi>Feaſts,</hi> till the day of <hi>blowing the Trumpets,</hi> and <hi>the Faſt,</hi> or Sackcloth; after which, follows the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant <hi>Feaſt</hi> of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> ſo celebrated <hi>Numb.</hi> 29. by the Ennumeration of every Day's Services, like the <hi>cleanſing of the Sanctuary,</hi> by the ſolemn Obſervation of it at the <hi>reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Jeruſalem, Ezra</hi> 3. 4. in Image of the New <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 8. after the <hi>Feaſt of Trumpets,</hi> with <hi>Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches, Pine, Myrrh, Palm-branches, ver.</hi> 15. like dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in a <hi>Garden of Eden,</hi> and in Reſemblance of the <hi>Palms, Revel.</hi> 7. 9. and as a <hi>prophetical Emblem of the Paradiſe of God, Revel.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>c.</hi> 22. 2. compar'd: according to all which, the Prophet <hi>Zechar.</hi> ſo diſtinguiſhly proclaims in that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>Prophecy</hi> of the Glory of Chriſt's Kingdom, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. this <hi>Feaſt of Tabernacles,</hi> v. 16. and as if it were the entring a Caution againſt underſtanding that, as the True <hi>Feaſt of Tabernacles, Nehem.</hi> 8. 4.

And how excellently do the ſeven Thunders ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their Voices, agree with the Trumpets ſounding ſo long? For towards the latter Time of the ſixth Trumpet,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41903:85"/> and at the laſt 180 Days beginning, the Goſpel Law was given in theſe Thunders, like thoſe of the Law, <hi>Exodus</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 28.</p>
                  <p>Thus all things concurring, even to Miracle, or a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Almighty Wiſdom and Power of God, I cannot doubt, I have fix'd upon the true Epoch, or Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Line of 1260 <hi>days,</hi> at 437, and ſo upon the end of it at 1697.</p>

                  <p>From hence, whatever Power acted by <hi>Sathan,</hi> to an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring to a ſupreme Reſidency in the <hi>Fourth,</hi> or <hi>Roman Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> in the <hi>days</hi> of which <hi>Chriſt's Kingdom</hi> was foretold <hi>to be ſet up,</hi> and of all Right ought to have been ſo, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to the Duty and Obligation of all Mankind, becauſe of his Sovereign <hi>Reſurrection</hi> after his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of himſelf for the <hi>Life of the World,</hi> and that then the <hi>Roman Monarchy</hi> was the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the <hi>Oecumene,</hi> or habitable Earth in Symbol of Prophecy; whatever Power therefore did not then acknowledge that Kingdom, nor that Truth of Chriſtianity, any way either ſeated in, or attempting that Monarchy, is under a Character of <hi>Draconick;</hi> the Notion of which came into eſpecial date ſince that <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt, and his Right thereby to an univerſal Monarchy: at which Time <hi>the Roman Ceſareate</hi> ariſen to that <hi>univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> from the Time of the more publick Notices of the Right of Chriſt, inſpir'd by <hi>Sathan</hi> with a <hi>Draconick Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>watchfulneſs waited</hi> to <hi>devour</hi> that <hi>princely Birth</hi> (of which <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Cruelty to Gods <hi>typical firſt-born,</hi> lying as a <hi>Dragon</hi> in the <hi>Egyptian Nile</hi> was a Type) and was therefore by the moſt notable ſignancy of the Symbol inveſted with the <hi>Draconick</hi> Title.</p>
                  <p>But when the Acknowledgment of Jeſus, as <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Lord,</hi> was made by the Chriſtian <hi>Roman Emperour, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> and his Succeſſors, Chriſt was then in eminent Type <hi>caught up to the Throne of God,</hi> never to be dethron'd, as we ſee he is not to this day, notwithſtanding the Combat of the

                     <hi>Birth</hi> was caught up to the Throne of God; but that was only in preparation, and to match with the other Symbols; But now the Church was indeed out of view, by the <hi>Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> introduc'd by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> the <hi>Beaſts people</hi> under the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Beaſt;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Falſe Church</hi> hid the <hi>True,</hi> as in a <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs:</hi> The <hi>Gentiles</hi> crowded the <hi>True worſhippers</hi> into a <hi>clos'd Temple, The Daily was taken away; The witneſſes</hi> were in <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> where then could the True Church be ſeen?

                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>Satan,</hi> however in his Serpentine, and <hi>draconick</hi> Nature, jealous of any thing of Chriſt even in his own Kingdom, firſt perſecutes the <hi>Empire</hi> by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> where He knew, the <hi>woman</hi> very lately was by her bringing forth the <hi>Manly Birth;</hi> He ſtruck at it by way of diſtinction in his own Aym, but finding He could not reach it by the rude ſtrokes of the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> but the <hi>Eagles wings</hi> had convey'd it away, and finding that thoſe <hi>Barbarous</hi> Nations, ſetled by degrees into the <hi>Antichriſtian Chriſtianity,</hi> and ſo help'd it forward into the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> He then reſolved to be ſure of it, attempted to ſwallow it by the <hi>Mahometan Flood;</hi> But This neither diſtinguiſhing it, nor ſucceeding becauſe the <hi>Beſtian Earth drunk up the Flood,</hi> not only recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it upon it ſelf, but maintaining the name, Doctrine, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and Church ſtate of Chriſtianity, ſo far as is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary abſolutely to <hi>Antichriſtianiſme</hi> and its Kingdom, ſo drunk up the Flood by ſetting it ſelf againſt the blaſphemous, monſtrous, Mahometan Impoſture, and with a deadly hate, becauſe <hi>Mahometaniſm</hi> is no leſs againſt <hi>Antichristianity,</hi> than Chriſtianity, ſo the Serpent diſappointed is wroth, and, as ſo neceſſitated, determines now to ſift for his Ends, by <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coniſm</hi> refin'd into <hi>Beastianiſm, Heatheniſm</hi> guilded with Chriſtianity, but pointed and edg'd with Antichriſtianiſme, which is a compound of the <hi>Dragon</hi> and the <hi>Beast:</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Antichriſtian ſtate allowed ſuch a thing as a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, tho but it ſelf only, He can <hi>make war</hi> only with the <hi>womans ſeed;</hi> And to the purpoſe, and, as we ſay, with a Vengeance.

                  <p>Now how admirable is all this, according to the Symbols, the <hi>Beast</hi> ſtill in all appearance and ſemblance ſecures Chriſt on <hi>the Throne,</hi> while it ſupplants his true Kingdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: for how could <hi>Antichriſt's Kingdom ſtand</hi> if Chriſt were not in Title upon the Throne?

                  </p>
                  <p>Again, the <hi>Wings</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtatiz'd Empire,</hi> while they convey the <hi>true Church</hi> out of all ordinary Viſibility, yet ſecure it in the Name and Notion of a <hi>Church:</hi> the Beaſt's Earth thus helps it; for a <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> is his Claim, and Title to his <hi>Kingdom:</hi> but it muſt be <hi>hidden;</hi> for a <hi>true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church viſible</hi> deſtroys his <hi>Kingdom.</hi> Thus all things even to Aſtoniſhment at the <hi>divine Prophetick Wiſdom</hi> have a Harmony in Truth, greater than that of the Spheres in Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Pagan Infidels</hi> by ſubverting <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> neceſſarily overthrow <hi>Antichriſt's Kingdom</hi> alſo: it is in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable need of Chriſtianity ſo far as a Pretence goes, but the Brightneſs and native Glory conſumes it; while Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity under a falſe mask ſupports it, true Chriſtianity ſcorches it to nothing, as will be ſeen at the <hi>Vial pour'd</hi> into
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41903:94"/> 
                     <hi>the Sun;</hi> true Chriſtianity and the Church therefore muſt be <hi>hidden,</hi> and in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> and its <hi>Seed perſecuted</hi> as if not of the <hi>Church,</hi> that <hi>falſe Chriſtianity</hi> and the <hi>falſe Church</hi> may reign in its Abſence under its Name and Appearance.</p>
                  <p>Thus while the <hi>Dragon</hi> perſecutes in his Aim and Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> pretending it ſelf the <hi>

                  <p>That we may then have the perfect Pourtracture of this <hi>other Beaſt,</hi> who manag'd all things from the Beginning of the <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> during the <hi>wounded State</hi> of the <hi>Grand Beaſt</hi> in <hi>one,</hi> viz. the <hi>ſixth of its Heads,</hi> call'd the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and the Infancy of the <hi>Grand Beaſt,</hi> viz. as united to its <hi>ſeventh Head,</hi> call'd in this Prophecy moſt often, <hi>The Beaſt;</hi> We may thus behold Him the <hi>other Beaſt,</hi> ſo far as his Deſcription reaches, while the <hi>Grand Beaſt</hi> lay <hi>wounded,</hi> which was till the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Months began: by which great Preparation will be made to underſtand that <hi>Grand Beaſt.</hi>

                  <p>From the whole then, theſe two Things ariſe to our main Purpoſe: 1. That this <hi>other Beaſt</hi> muſt be the whole <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Office of the <hi>VVeſtern</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern Roman Empire</hi> under its Superiors, or <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> ſo far as it was grown <hi>Apoſtatical, Antichriſtian,</hi> and <hi>Pſeudo prophetick,</hi> or into falſe Prophecy, from the very beginning of the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> at 437, to the end of it at 1697, and beyond that, in what State ſoever it ſhall be, till it is <hi>caſt into the Lake</hi> with the <hi>Beast.</hi> With this Exception, before the <hi>Beaſts</hi> coming to the <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of it ſelf, this <hi>Beaſt</hi> hath the Regency, and ſo the Type of a <hi>Beaſt;</hi> after that it ſubſides into bare <hi>falſe Prophetiſm,</hi> but ſuch as is inſeparable from the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and the <hi>Beaſt</hi> from it; ſo that they rule together, but the Supremacy is in the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> and they <hi>fall,</hi> and are caſt into the Lake together.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Action of this <hi>other Beaſt,</hi> till the <hi>forty two months,</hi> is its ſhaping its own Beſtianiſm, both into the Body under it, and its Superiority over its own Body. Its <hi>ſpeaking as a Dragon,</hi> and governing the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who are call'd the <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>them that dwell therein,</hi> herein exerciſing the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

And <hi>this other Beaſt</hi> gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, rul'd, and conducted them, as <hi>paganiſhly</hi> affected to a new <hi>Antichriſtian Paganiſm</hi> in preparation for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Head, without whoſe Succeſſion the Grand Beaſt had been extinct.

                  <p>I come now to the laſt Thing neceſſary before the Entry into the <hi>Beaſts</hi> forty two Months; that is, to ſettle the State of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> as in its general view under the whole 1260 Days, and more particularly in this Interval from the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy</hi> beginning unto the <hi>Beaſts forty two Months.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> as hath been already declar'd, are the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>VVoman,</hi> the <hi>True Church,</hi> who <hi>keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God,</hi> and <hi>hold the Teſtimony,</hi> the <hi>VVitneſs,</hi> the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyry</hi> of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>

                  <p> Theſe are in <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> as the beſt of their State, the whole 1260 Days; but their Time is diſtinguiſh'd by three great Pairs of <hi>VVitneſſes</hi> in the Old Teſtament, whoſe Hiſtory ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the varying Types of their Condition; <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel, Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha, Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> who though in <hi>mournful Garments,</hi> as <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and in union with him, <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel,</hi> is repreſented, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet They were as two <hi>Olive Branches</hi> to the <hi>Church of the Jews,</hi> which was at that Time, the <hi>Candleſtick ſtanding before the God of the whole Earth.</hi> And this is the firſt Repreſentation of the <hi>VVitneſſes;</hi> for they are alſo the <hi>two Olive Trees,</hi> and the <hi>two Candleſticks ſtanding before the God of the Earth, Revel.</hi> 11. 6. compar'd with <hi>Zech. c.</hi> 4. And it compriſes the certain Aſſurance and Expectation of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> and its <hi>glorious Sanctuary,</hi> even as the <hi>typical Temple,</hi> and its <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were ſo far ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by thoſe <hi>two great perſonages:</hi> But beyond that, They had the Promiſes of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> State, peculiarly made to them; to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Zech. 3. 7. <hi>places among the Angels ſtanding by in that Viſion,</hi> as Attendants on Chriſt, to <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel, Haggai</hi> 2. 21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When that Overthrow of Kingdoms ſhould be, which could be no other than that at the ſeventh Vial. <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> ſhall be a <hi>Signet;</hi> and to all God's People throughout the Prophecy of <hi>Zechar.</hi> the ſame Promiſes are confirmed; and ſo to theſe two Witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>VVitneſſes</hi> then at this Time, by <hi>holy Doctrine, pure VVorſhip, unſpotted Sanctity,</hi> begin their Teſtimony, and are <hi>truly</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Prophets,</hi> or Perſons of a <hi>magiſtratical Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter</hi> and Eminency, or truly fit for ſuch a Dignity; and as <hi>the Sons of Oyl, or anointed ones,</hi> Zech. 4. ult. <hi>They empty the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Oyl</hi> into the two <hi>golden Candleſticks,</hi> into the Souls of the Servants and People of God, the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>VVoman,</hi> who from the beginning of the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> to the end of it, are Members, and make up thoſe two Churches, <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatyra;</hi> which, as I have ſhewn in its Place, run parallel in <hi>Pergamus</hi> at the beginning, and <hi>Thyatyra</hi> in the latter part
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41903:97"/> with the whole <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> although the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> firſt, and <hi>Philadelphia</hi> at laſt, do indeed undertake the Line drawn by the <hi>Churches</hi> through the whole <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> before the <hi>Church of Thyatyra,</hi> in its real Subſiſtence, ſhall ceaſe to bear that Type of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> it is appointed to ſuſtain.</p>
                  <p>Now how admirably does this agree with the ſtate of the <hi>true Chriſtian Witneſſes</hi> for ſome conſiderable ſpace after the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> beginning? They did indeed <hi>put on Sackcloth</hi> in God's Account, aſſoon as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> came into the <hi>holy ground</hi> with their <hi>unhallowed feet,</hi> ſhod with <hi>Paganiſh Superſtition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But They at firſt, and for ſome ſpace of time, rather <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied the golden Oyl out of themſelves,</hi> than were under Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and Sufferings; They ſent out the Holy Doctrine, and <hi>chrystal Stream</hi> of <hi>Evangelical Truth;</hi> The Worſhip of God they directed, was tranſparent, clear, and pure, without <hi>Paganiſh</hi> Mixtures and Ceremonies; and the Converſation they preach'd and gave Example of, was not foul, ranck, <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid,</hi> but holy, gracious, pellucid, of an excellent <hi>Odour</hi> and <hi>Fragrancy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And although Hiſtory is not juſt, and ſincere enough to give account hereof, paſſing through the <hi>Feculencies</hi> of the <hi>beginning Apoſtacy,</hi> and ſuffering under all its particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries more than thoſe of Time, and obſcur'd, as under that cover'd State, in which the Church now was; yet we are not under a total want of ſuch Monuments of the Witneſſes Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. But for the Corruptions they were to teſtifie againſt, they are too notorious to be denied, as ſuch Beginnings of the Apoſtacy, even at this very joynt of Time; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the conſtant care of God in preſerving a <hi>Seed</hi> that is <hi>accovnted to the Lord for a Generation,</hi> and particularly by the Types of this Prophecy, we are moſt aſſured there muſt be ſuch <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and ſuch muſt be their <hi>Testimony.</hi>

                     <hi>Wherein, The</hi> Forty Two Months <hi>are meaſur'd by the exacteſt Rules of</hi> Prophecy, <hi>and found by expreſs Concurrencies of thoſe</hi> Prophecies <hi>to begin at the Ceſſation of the</hi> Chriſtian Weſtern Empire, <hi>and to end whenever the</hi> 1260 Days <hi>end, (the Date of the</hi> Kingdom of Chriſt <hi>immediately enſuing) and therefore to begin at</hi> 475, <hi>and by compare with the</hi> 1260 Days <hi>to end at</hi> 1697. <hi>According to which, the State of the</hi> Empire, <hi>of the Adminiſtration of the</hi> Firſt Beaſt, <hi>and of the</hi> Witneſſes <hi>during the</hi> Fourth Trumpet, viz. <hi>from</hi> 475 <hi>to</hi> 606, <hi>is repreſented.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE Point of Time I am now entring upon, hath had a juſt Approach made to it according to its Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which is very great: I ſhall now, through the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Divine Spirit, duely conſider the moſt weighty ſenſe of it ſelf; there being no Line of Time, whoſe Bounds are ſo definitive, the Beginning ſo unconteſtably evident in Hiſtory, the End ſo illuſtrious, as this muſt be to ſenſe it ſelf, in the very nature of the thing.</p>
                  <p>That I may therefore diſcourſe hereof moſt regularly, I propoſe theſe four Heads to fix the Intendment upon.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To ſhew, That the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath affirm'd, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>the Man of Sin,</hi> or <hi>Beast,</hi> (whoſe End is according to all <hi>Prophecies</hi> concerning him, <hi>Deſtruction</hi> by the <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Appearance of Christ's Kingdom</hi> at that his end) hath an unmoveable Bar to his Manifeſtation till his <hi>own Time;</hi> and that the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> declares that Bar to be an indefeiſable Succeſſion of a <hi>ſeventh King, not come in his Time,</hi> to a <hi>ſixth King,</hi> then in <hi>Being</hi> in his Time, and <hi>that ſeventh King</hi> to endure a <hi>ſhort time,</hi> and that then <hi>the Beast,</hi> the <hi>eighth King</hi> ſhould ſucceed, and that he could ſucceed neither ſooner nor later. When therefore it will appear that ſuch a <hi>ſeventh King</hi> did ſucceed the <hi>ſixth,</hi> and that that <hi>ſeventh</hi> did deceaſe at
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41903:98"/> 475; if it ſhall alſo appear, as it will, that this is the very ſame Beaſt to whom <hi>forty two months</hi> are determin'd, it will then be moſt evident, his <hi>forty two months</hi> muſt begin at 475.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſhew, That the <hi>Kingdom of the Beast</hi> muſt laſt till the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> according to the ſame Laws of Succeſſion, can ſucceed, and it can laſt no longer; as alſo, that the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> muſt ſucceed when <hi>that Kingdom</hi> ends, and it can ſucceed no ſooner; if then, it is expreſly ſaid, the Kingdom of Chriſt ſhall immediately ſucceed the 1260 <hi>Days;</hi> and that according to this Law of Succeſſion, and the courſe of all <hi>Prophecy,</hi> it muſt alſo ſucceed the <hi>forty two months:</hi> it then will plainly follow, the 42 Months and the 1260 Days end together.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To ſhew, That the 1260 <hi>Days</hi> muſt be Time of the Sun, and the <hi>forty two months</hi> muſt be Time of the Moon; and ſeeing they muſt be adjuſted to one another, as ending together, and lying both within one common Womb of <hi>Time, Times, Half Time;</hi> The <hi>forty two months,</hi> by the moſt exact compare of Lunar and Solar Time, can be but 1222 Years; and therefore beſides all Advantages of Scripture-uſe of round Number, beginning at 475, they moſt exactly and moſt neceſſarily muſt end at 1697.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To ſhew, That the <hi>Beast</hi> indeed muſt have every way the Seminal, fundamental Nature of ſuch a <hi>Beaſt</hi> as he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd to be, at the very beginning of his <hi>forty two Months,</hi> as the Infant hath of a Man, but need not, nor cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to attain full <hi>prophetical</hi> Proportions, till long after, which Time <hi>Prophecy</hi> hath alſo dated to him by his Number 666. So that the deſcription of the Empire, according to the <hi>Fourth Trumpet,</hi> the Adminiſtration of the <hi>other Beaſt,</hi> and the State of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> may continue many Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as they ſtood at the <hi>forty two Months</hi> entring, and ſo <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> determines of them.</p>
                  <p>To begin then with the firſt of theſe, I find this Order and <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Head </seg>1</label> Concert of the Parts of it will be moſt convictive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative:
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41903:99"/> 1. That <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> ſpeak all of one and the ſame <hi>Beaſt.</hi> 2. That this <hi>one</hi> and the ſame <hi>Beaſt</hi> hath <hi>forty two months</hi> determin'd upon him, as the juſt State of his Duration. 3. That the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> hath declared that peremptory, poſitive Law of Succeſſion, that was the <hi>Let</hi> of the <hi>coming</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his <hi>forty two months.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt, Although a multitude of Proofs from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Concert of all Prophecy, which either have been or will be farther taken notice of, may be given; yet, That which I will reſt upon alone at this time, ſhall be that moſt convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive one, That his End is <hi>Deſtruction</hi> by the glorious <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> ſo that his eminent Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> in Conformity to that <hi>Apoſtate Apoſtle, Judas,</hi> ſo near the Glory of Chriſt's <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> ſo the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> twice deſcribes him, by his <hi>going into Perdition, Apoc.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 11. and his <hi>Deſtruction</hi> is ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, <hi>c.</hi> 19. and then the Kingdom of Chriſt ſucceeds, <hi>c.</hi> 20. <hi>c.</hi> 21. Thus <hi>Daniel</hi> in every <hi>Viſion;</hi> The great Image was ſmitten by the <hi>Stone cut out of the Mountains without hands, growing</hi> to a <hi>great Mountain, filling the Earth by a Kingdom never ending,</hi> in its <hi>ten-toed feet, part of Iron</hi> and <hi>part of Clay,</hi> ſo exactly compounded of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> out of the <hi>Sea,</hi> with his <hi>ten crowned Horns,</hi> inſeparably united with his <hi>falſe Prophetiſm, a Beaſt out of the Earth,</hi> Revel. 13. The <hi>little Horn</hi> is a <hi>Beaſt, deliver'd to the Flames,</hi> and the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom under the whole Heaven given to the Saints.</hi> The <hi>King ſtanding up againſt the Prince of Princes</hi> ſhall be <hi>broken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hand.</hi> At the <hi>Accompliſhing to ſcatter the Holy People,</hi> viz. by this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> as hath been made to <hi>appear;</hi> All the <hi>Wonders</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Kingdom</hi> ſhall be <hi>finiſhed, Dan. c.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> compar'd with <hi>Dan. c.</hi> 7. 11. <hi>&amp;c. c.</hi> 8. 24, 25. <hi>c.</hi> 12. 7. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſtiles him the <hi>Son of Perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and foretels his being <hi>conſumed</hi> with the <hi>Brightneſs</hi> of the <hi>Lords;</hi> viz. <hi>Chriſt's coming,</hi> and the <hi>Glory of his Appearance.</hi> Whoever then conſiders the moſt notable and notorious
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41903:99"/> 
                     <hi>Deſtruction</hi> always affix'd to one and the ſame kind of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſo even in all its manners of Deſcription, and ſuch a kind of <hi>Deſtruction</hi> as is always declar'd to iſſue and flow out from the <hi>Glory</hi> of Chriſt at <hi>his coming</hi> to his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> will find, It muſt be one and the ſame <hi>Beaſt,</hi> ſince Chriſt hath but one ſuch <hi>Coming</hi> and one ſuch <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as theſe are deſcrib'd to be; nor indeed is there any more than <hi>one ſuch Beaſt</hi> ſo ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in Time, Place, and Succeſſion, as this will appear to be.</p>
                  <p>It is in the ſecond place to be made out, that this is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſame <hi>Beast</hi> that hath <hi>Fourty two Months</hi> determin'd to Him; and though there needs nothing to make that good, but to take the two Chaps. <hi>c.</hi> 13. and <hi>c.</hi> 17. of the <hi>Apocal.</hi> and to write down all the particulars of agreement between thoſe two Beaſts; and it will be impoſſible for ſo much as the thinking Mind to doubt of their being one and the ſame: But I will only inſiſt upon the former Argument in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that <hi>Beaſt,</hi> that is ſo <hi>destroyed</hi> as the <hi>Beast</hi> in the <hi>c.</hi> 17. is to be deſtroyed, muſt needs according to the former Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be the ſame Beaſt. But the <hi>Beast</hi> that hath <hi>Fourty two Months,</hi> determin'd to his Continuunce <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 5. hath ſuch a Deſtruction affix'd to him as the <hi>Beast, c.</hi> 17. hath: For who can aſſume the Effrontery, or Boldneſs to deny, that the <hi>Beast, c.</hi> 19. who is taken and caſt into the <hi>Lake, v.</hi> 20. is the ſame with the <hi>Beast. c.</hi> 17. And the <hi>Beaſt c.</hi> 13. hath this very ſame <hi>Destruction</hi> foretold to him; For he is to be <hi>Taken,</hi> and to go into that Eternal <hi>Captivity</hi> of the <hi>Lake</hi> with his <hi>Falſe Prophet</hi> inſeparable from him, according to <hi>v.</hi> 10. and his <hi>Ten Crowned Horns,</hi> or whole Circle of <hi>Kings</hi> are to be <hi>killed with the Sword of Christ's Mouth, c.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 21. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with <hi>ch.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 10. he that leadeth into Captivity ſhall go, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he that kills with the Sword, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now Chriſt's Captivation and Killing are ſuch as argues Divine Juſtice and Power, and ſuch is that declar'd, <hi>c.</hi> 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> hath declar'd that ſo obſtinate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yielding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Bar to the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> being reveal'd, ſtill in his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41903:100"/> Time, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> moſt emphatically ſpeaks, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the impoſſibility of his <hi>Coming,</hi> till that his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Time;</hi> Now the occaſion of that great Apoſtolical Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph was an Expectation of a ſudden Appearance of the <note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.</note> Glory of Chriſt's Kingdom; this very Kingdom, of which we are now ſpeaking; which was the great Expectation of the Apoſtles, till they were better Inſtructed, and of other Chriſtians after them upon a general, but not particular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of <hi>Scripture Prophecy;</hi> For that this <hi>Day</hi> was the <hi>day</hi> of <hi>Judgment,</hi> there is no Senſe for, in thoſe lightſome Days before the Apoſtacy, ſeeing all the <hi>Prophecies</hi> are big with a Glorious ſtate of Chriſtianity in this World. To this the Apoſt. for their Information, and of after Ages much more, ſpeaks punctually; That it could not be expected ſo ſoon, and does moſt vehemently obteſtate by the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, and our <hi>gathering</hi> unto him againſt the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation: for ſaith he, There muſt be an Apoſtacy firſt, and the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> muſt be reveal'd; but that muſt be in his own proper Time, and not before; for there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a Perſon witholding, and a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an effectual Thing, <hi>witholding,</hi> or each of theſe taking ſuch Faſt <hi>Hold</hi> of their proper Space and Time, that the <hi>Beſtian Prince</hi> cannot come forward till they by going off let go their <hi>Hold,</hi> and then ſhall be <hi>reveal'd</hi> that <hi>lawleſs</hi> one, that <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> which is an Expoſition of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, when it is to be underſtood of a Body of Succeſſors. So this is the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> Senſe, <hi>The day of Chriſt,</hi> viz. of his <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> cannot <hi>come,</hi> till the <hi>Man of Sin come: The Man of Sin comes</hi> indeed out of the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> as out of a <hi>Womb;</hi> but as no Birth can, ſo he cannot <hi>come</hi> till his own <hi>Time: Sathan</hi> is eager enough; every thing <hi>works</hi> to it as faſt as it can: <hi>the Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> is now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready at this very moment at <hi>work.</hi> But every Thing that God hath ordain'd will hold its own, its own Time, its own Place; and ſuch a <hi>Holding</hi> Thing there is, and ſuch a <hi>Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Perſon there is that poſſeſſes, and fills that Time and Place.</p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:41903:100"/>
                  <p> Thus far the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> goes in his <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> ſo far he was order'd by the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to go, and no farther; the reſt he refers to former Perſonal Diſcourſe. Now whatever prudential reaſon there might be of ſaying no more; The great Reaſon was, the <hi>Holy dictating Spirit</hi> order'd no more; but that all Scripture might be ſearch'd and compar'd: Holy Writers ſay ſo much in one place, ſo much in another; ſo much one Holy Writer ſays, ſo much more is ſaid by another; by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones part the Harmony is made up.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> therefore ſpeaking; as I have prov'd of the ſame great Matter, and aiming at the <hi>Glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of Chriſt, the grand ſcope of all <hi>Prophecy,</hi> declares the Reaſon why the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Chriſt could not <hi>Come,</hi> becauſe there was an unalterable Succeſſion determin'd by <hi>God</hi> before that Kingdom: There were <hi>ſeven Kings, five</hi> of them he gives in the Lump, becauſe <hi>Prophecy</hi> was not concern'd in them, or in the manner or order of their Succeſſion; they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Character of the Monarchy, a diſtinctive of the <hi>Fourth Beaſt</hi> by its <hi>ſeven Heads,</hi> or Forms of Government, in a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion as Kings ſignifie, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. But in three of them the <hi>Prophecy</hi> then in motion by the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> was highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted; The firſt <hi>was then,</hi> and it was in its courſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>five of the ſeven Seals:</hi> The <hi>ſeventh King</hi> was not yet <hi>Come,</hi> it was not very far off comparatively, but it was not as yet <hi>Come,</hi> it was to come in the <hi>ſixth Seal,</hi> and when it came, there was a neceſſity upon him, he muſt continue by the ſame Comparativeneſs but a ſhort ſpace, <hi>viz.</hi> during on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the time of the <hi>ſixth</hi> and <hi>ſeventh Seals;</hi> Now this <hi>ſeventh</hi> the Spirit is induſtrious to aſſure us, He was the Chriſtian <hi>Emperour;</hi> though he was a <hi>King</hi> of that great City, and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> yet he pertain'd not to the <hi>Beaſt;</hi> indeed there was a Declination to the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> in his time, but the <hi>Church</hi> was yet pure all thoſe <hi>Seals,</hi> as appears by them; it appears too it was declining, the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> drew near; a declining from one Degree to another there had been from the firſt <hi>Operation</hi> of the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Iniquity,</hi> forming the <hi>Antichriſtian Prince</hi> no
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41903:101"/> with great Curioſity in the loweſt parts of the <hi>Earth,</hi> where no Eye ſaw the way of the <hi>Sathanick Spirit,</hi> but he, before whom <hi>Hell and Deſtruction have no Covering.</hi> However, this <hi>Chriſtian Emperour</hi> was none of the <hi>Heads,</hi> but <hi>wounded</hi> the <hi>Pagan ſixth Draconick Head.</hi> The <hi>Beast,</hi> he is <hi>the eighth,</hi> and is of the <hi>ſeven;</hi> Seven, what but Heads? Clearly joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Viſion</hi> with the <hi>ſeven Heads,</hi> of Chap. 13. <hi>He,</hi> that as the <hi>Son of Perdition goes into Perdition;</hi> I ſay again, <hi>Goeth into Perdition,</hi> that Perdition juſt before the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Chriſt, and ſo hath no Succeſſor, but Chriſt <hi>conſuming him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this Succeſſion ſtands firm; God himſelf had fix'd it. As then no Prince can ſucceed till the former is avaunted, in ſo exact a <hi>Succeſſion</hi> one cannot crowd out another, no more than one Month or a Day following can crowd out the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent; but when any goes off, the next ſucceeds immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately: there can be no Vacuity, <hi>Rex nunquam moritur,</hi> where God holds the Succeſſion, and its Law firm; and ſo it is to the very <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Juſt then when the <hi>Chriſtian Emperour</hi> deceas'd, tht <hi>Beſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperour ſucceeded;</hi> and that was indiſputably at 475, and then his <hi>forty two Months</hi> of Duration ſucceeded: and it was a large Time, as <hi>Prophecy</hi> draws them out; and they are ſtill current; they muſt have been yet a long time ago begun, for there was the <hi>ſixth King</hi> in <hi>Being</hi> when the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> wrote, ſignifying his Time then in ſpending. The <hi>ſeventh</hi> had no long time; That end of things the Apoſtle declares, <hi>Ch.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 19. <hi>c.</hi> 20. <hi>c.</hi> 21. is beyond all Controverſie upon due, yea, but ſmall Conſideration, not yet <hi>come.</hi> Therefore this <hi>eighth</hi> King muſt have been long upon the Throne, and now near the end of his <hi>forty two months.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For he <hi>came</hi> at the very firſt of them: He came then, though as an Infant Prince a Prince as in the Cradle, yet then <hi>he came.</hi> Humane Hiſtory is not more competent to declare the Time when <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was <hi>born,</hi> than the <hi>Jews</hi> could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce aright when <hi>the Chriſt</hi> was <hi>born;</hi> yet ſome choſen Obſervers there were of the one and of the other, ſome or
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41903:101"/> alarming Indications: The Father <hi>Jerom</hi> ſounded it aloud, or rather by Inſpiration before hand proclaim'd it; but God hath judg'd it, he hath declar'd it, and there can be no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty in it; When the ſhort-liv'd Chriſtian <hi>Emperours</hi> and their <hi>Empire</hi> dyed in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> then it was; The true Seat of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> being at <hi>ſeven headed ſeven hill'd Rome,</hi> was by a wonderful Operation of Providence, quitted by the <hi>Dragon</hi> to be the <hi>Seat of the Beaſt;</hi> the Chriſtian <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> reſided elſewhere moſt, for ſtill that was the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the Beſtian <hi>Empire; Constantinople</hi> did but borrow the Name by a ſecret of Providence, of <hi>Nova Roma,</hi> as uſeful for ſome <hi>Types of Prophecy;</hi> when the <hi>Chriſtian Weſtern Empire</hi> was ceſſated; then the Eighth <hi>King</hi> ſucceeded, his <hi>Fourty two Months</hi> then began.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the ſecond Head of this Diſcourſe; The <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Head </seg>2</label> Kingdom of Chriſt muſt <hi>come</hi> immediately after the <hi>Beasts Fourty two months</hi> ended; The Law of the Succeſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, it muſt be then immediately <hi>proclaim'd;</hi> It does not appear all at once, no Kingdom does ſo: But its Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are <hi>ſeventy five Years;</hi> So great, ſo glorious an <hi>Empire,</hi> ſo juſt, ſo even, and cubical in its <hi>Thouſand Years,</hi> muſt have an honourable Preparation; And it is but ſhort in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon; During this time all ſorts of warnings are given by the <hi>ſeven Thunders unſeal'd,</hi> Revel. 14. all kind of Juſtice done upon Offenders by the <hi>Vials, c.</hi> 16.

                     <hi>of this World are become the Kingdoms of the Lord,</hi> and of his <hi>Chriſt,</hi> therefore laſtly, the <hi>forty two months</hi> muſt end with the 1260 <hi>days,</hi> for Chriſt abated nothing of them by his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> overhaſtily, as is to be ſhewn, and the <hi>Beaſt</hi> was to have ſo many for his Reign.</p>
                  <p>The 1260 <hi>days,</hi> and the <hi>forty two months</hi> ending together, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Head. </seg>3</label> and the <hi>forty two Months</hi> beginning at 475, they muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted one to the other, as one being Time of the Sun, the other, as Time of the Moon.</p>
                  <p>For as in all Languages, and parts of the World, Days muſt, and do ſignifie moſt properly the Time, meaſured by the Sun; ſo in the <hi>eaſtern,</hi> and moſt eſpecially the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> and Scripture Language; <hi>Months</hi> ſignifie only, and ſolely the Time, as meaſured by the Moon, and are call'd <hi>Novitates Newneſſes,</hi> or Times meaſured by each new Congreſs of the Moon with the Sun, or <hi>new Moons:</hi> ſo that however another way of ſpeaking hath prevailed with us, a Month of the Sun is as improper, as a day of the night, or a day meaſured by the Moon; ſo that if words can ſignifie as they are always in Scripture us'd to ſignifie, Months muſt ſignifie Time accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the motion of the Moon.</p>
                  <p>And further, as hath been already ſhewn, the Symbol is of the peculiar uſe in this <hi>Prophecy</hi> to ſemble Time of the Night, of the Moon, that the <hi>True Church</hi> hath under its <hi>Feet,</hi> and as ſhall be more ſeen in a great Remarque upon the <hi>Mahometan Moon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe therefore <hi>days, months, years,</hi> as they are within this Line of Time, muſt all lye within <hi>Time, Times, half Time,</hi> and equal 1260 <hi>days,</hi> or <hi>years;</hi> There are twice <hi>Forty two Months,</hi> that knitting one within another, will ſupply the ſhortneſs to 1260 <hi>Days,</hi> or <hi>Years,</hi> of the <hi>Forty two Months,</hi> either of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ending thirty eight years ſooner, or thoſe of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> beginning thirty eight years later than thoſe 1260 <hi>Days.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, as the <hi>Moon</hi> could be no <hi>Moon,</hi> if there were no <hi>Sun</hi> to lend it Light; ſo the <hi>Sun</hi> on a body prepared, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to it, as the Moon, caſts a Light like that of the Moon,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41903:102"/> certainly and without fail: In the ſame manner there could be no Antichriſtian <hi>months,</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> if there were not a true <hi>Church,</hi> and its <hi>Seed,</hi> the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> cloth'd with the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> all thoſe 1260 <hi>Years,</hi> which caſt thoſe Months; And if there be ſuch a body as the Antichriſtian <hi>Church,</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the Chriſtian <hi>Church,</hi> as that does, it muſt needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive <hi>Months</hi> from its <hi>Days,</hi> equal one to the other.</p>
                  <p>And it is moſt apparent, that waving Scriptures <hi>round Number;</hi> Unto the exactneſs of conſiderably leſs than a Years difference, the Time of <hi>Forty two prophetical months,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted by the ſtricteſt Accountant to the time of 1260 <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Days,</hi> meaſured by the <hi>Moon's</hi> motion, from one new Conjunction with the <hi>Sun</hi> to another, will be as 1222 <hi>Years</hi> to 1260 <hi>Years;</hi> ſo that if the <hi>forty two months</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> begin at 475, the 1260 <hi>days</hi> beginning at 437, they will both end neceſſarily at 1697; which is the thing that ought to be ſhewn, ſo great an Exactneſs, ſo ſurely arguing the true Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of this Line, I hope, all will agree, cannot be bychance.</p>
                  <p>I requeſt then, I ſay, a ſtrictneſs of Account, which to avoid both longſomneſs and perplexity in this Diſcourſe, I do not give, but by ſo ſtrict Account, two miſtakes will be eſcaped, which may ariſe from a general apprehenſion of this Matter; For it will then be found, the Calculation is not to be made by accounting the Time of a Synodical Month to twenty nine <hi>days,</hi> ſo many <hi>hours, &amp;c.</hi> which makes the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar year 354 <hi>days</hi> ſo many Hours and Scruples, nor by rating the 1260 <hi>days,</hi> as three <hi>Years</hi> and <hi>half,</hi> which wants about five days of the true Solar Year, and then proportioning the Lunar Year of 364 <hi>Days,</hi> odd <hi>Hours</hi> and <hi>Scruples</hi> to a Year of only 360 <hi>days;</hi> But the true Scale of Time between the Sun and Moons motion in that which is call'd the <hi>middle courſe</hi> of each, reſpecting their Conjunction one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is to be taken; and I affirm to the moſt rigid Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician concerning it, it will prove exact to about half a years diſtance. That 1260 years of the Sun will exceed forty two Months ſpace of the Moon <hi>prophetically</hi> underſtood thirty
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41903:103"/> eight years. For as <hi>Maimonides,</hi> the moſt learned accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Time, ſettles this matter in his ſevere computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Time, in order to their <hi>new moons Solemnities.</hi> There is eleven days within ſome hours difference betwixt the lunar year and the ſolar, naturally given as 365 days; judge then how little can the want of the five days to make up the ſolar year 365 days, alter the account of 11 days dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in a year betwixt the Sun and Moon, which riſes from above 72 five days in a year, to make them nearer equal one to the other, than eleven days difference carries with it of inequality.</p>
                  <p>But I fear to be over tedious in this matter, although the wonderful exactneſs of the account does detain my Thoughts, aſſuring a Line of Time, confirmed ſo many ways beſides, to have its <hi>Epoch</hi> at 437, and its <hi>Period</hi> at 1697; by even ſo unexpected an agreement of the <hi>Beaſts forty two months,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly beginning at 475, and therefore the <hi>Witneſſes twelve hundred ſixty days</hi> thirty eight years before them, while the <hi>Gentiles forty two months</hi> are ready to ſet out with thoſe 1260 days, that ſo the time of the <hi>Beſtian Tyranny,</hi> and the <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of the <hi>Servants</hi> of <hi>God</hi> may begin and end together, as they ought to do.</p>
                  <p>I come therefore to the fourth head, to conſider the ſtate of the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> at his firſt riſing, or his forty two Months beginning thus at 475, and to compare therewith the Adminiſtration of the <hi>other Beaſt</hi> and the <hi>Prophecy of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> as they ſtood in the interval from 475 to 606; For indeed there is very little of a new ſcene of things opening till then; and therefore the great buſineſs of this head will be to ſettle the eſſential Lineaments of the grand <hi>Apocalyptical Beaſt</hi> according to the <hi>prophetical Iconiſmes</hi> of <hi>chap.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>c.</hi> 17. of the <hi>Revel.</hi> and to compare therewith the Imagery, given <hi>Dan. c.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 11. and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul's</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. and the Apoſtle <hi>John's</hi> ſhort Accounts of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtles;</hi> wherein I do not yet ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to diſplay the Quality and Action of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41903:103"/> will be more advantagiouſly done hereafter; for at this time they were but ſeminal, and ſo not diſcoverable, nor open, and there was an accidental Variableneſs therein. But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign thoſe invariable and unalterable Eſſentials which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, although they appear each in their juſt Seaſons, and which are fundamental to the <hi>Beast.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now herein I do ſolemnly avow, I will bring no precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd <hi>Idea,</hi> or Shape of the <hi>Beast</hi> to the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> but ſearch for that true one <hi>Prophecy</hi> gives, and receive it from its hand as wholly unpoſſeſs'd of any Notions of Him before-hand; and then referr to general and uncontroverted <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> as to an Umpirage moſt impartial, the Agreement of Things with <hi>Prophecy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor do I deſign to prove any Name or kind of Power in the World to be this <hi>Beast,</hi> but only to prove, That there hath been and muſt be ſuch a one to ſuſtain the <hi>Prophetick</hi> Characters during theſe <hi>forty two Months;</hi> and what will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow, I can't Fore-Fend.</p>
                  <p>To this Purpoſe I muſt make theſe three Premiſals:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That when <hi>Prophecy</hi> gives an entire <hi>prophetical Scheme</hi> of a <hi>Monarchy</hi> or this <hi>Beſtianiſm,</hi> it repreſents, as entire and eſſential to that Scheme, Things that did not fill it firſt; as <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> giving the Character of an Empire, gives it at full; or ſo of any Prince, and not as things were in their mere In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy. Thus thoſe things are given into the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Beast</hi> at his <hi>forty two Months beginning,</hi> which were not compleat till many Years after; as his Ten Horns, his Great Power and Authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now this ought to be no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the <hi>Prophetick Scheme,</hi> no more than that the Picture of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> as a <hi>Man</hi> or an <hi>Emperour,</hi> would not fit his Infancy, eſpecially when <hi>Prophecy</hi> defines the Time when he ſhall attain that <hi>Image, viz.</hi> 666.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When <hi>Prophecy</hi> gives the Portraicture of a particular laſt ſtate of a <hi>Monarchy</hi> that had a variety of States before it, it unites that laſt State as ſo one with the former, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with that juſt before it, as that they are ſpoken of as
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41903:104" rendition="simple:additions"/> one common State juſt at one Time; for this belongs to the Glory of <hi>Prophecies Preſcience</hi> and <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> to which, paſt, and preſent, and to come, are one, to give things thus entire in one.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Prophecy</hi> gives the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the ſixth Head in the <hi>Beast</hi> of <hi>ſeven Heads, ſeven Heads,</hi> when it wanted one as to preſent Event: and if it had to do with any of the <hi>five fallen Heads</hi> in the Time of the Apocalypſe given, it had done the ſame undoubtedly, becauſe the <hi>Scheme</hi> is but one although it be at ſeveral Times filled up: ſo the Scheme has always 7 Heads.</p>
                  <p>And thus it gives the <hi>grand Apocalyptick Beast</hi> whatever was before it; the <hi>five fallen Heads in the Lump,</hi> that they make a Character of it; nay, the whole <hi>Image, Dan.</hi> 2. in the <hi>three Beasts, Dan.</hi> 7. the <hi>Grecian Leopard,</hi> the <hi>Perſian Bear,</hi> and the <hi>Babylonian Lyon,</hi> are united to this laſt State of the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>fourth Monarchy,</hi> and even whole entire <hi>Beſtianiſm;</hi> becauſe in it that <hi>Image</hi> was to be <hi>beaten to Powder, Dan.</hi> 2. 34, 35. and the <hi>Lyon,</hi> the <hi>Bear,</hi> and the <hi>Leopard,</hi> who had their <hi>Lives prolonged, Time</hi> at large, and intimate <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Seaſon,</hi> were now to be <hi>kill'd with the Sword of Chriſt's Mouth,</hi> when the <hi>Beast,</hi> the <hi>Little Horn,</hi> is given to the <hi>conſuming Flames,</hi> or to <hi>the Lake, Dan.</hi> 7. 11, 12. with <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 21. So that it is no wonder it is called the <hi>Beast wounded in one of its Heads, viz.</hi> the <hi>ſixth Head,</hi> before it came unto its Succeſſion or <hi>forty two months;</hi> that it is called in the ſame manner the <hi>first Beast</hi> twice, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 12. for all <hi>Beſtianiſm</hi> is ſo total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his, that the <hi>Dragon,</hi> with whom he is more eſpecially united, as his immediate Predeceſſor, that hath the <hi>ſeven Heads</hi> and <hi>ten Horns</hi> becauſe it was the <hi>Roman Beast</hi> under the <hi>ſixth Head,</hi> yet is carefully forepriz'd from the Name <hi>Beaſt,</hi> that it might not derogate from the Univerſal <hi>Beſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm</hi> of this <hi>grand Beaſt;</hi> yea though it is he in whom <hi>this Beaſt was wounded.</hi> There is only a ſhort Allowance of the Name of the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> the <hi>other Beaſt</hi> to him who is erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>ſeventh Head</hi> into its Supremacy and Dignity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is ſo one with him, as the <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> and but for the time he is ſo erecting him.</p>

                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:41903:104"/> 3. That the <hi>prophetical Scheme</hi> may be underſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> it is to be duely ſtated, where the Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of each part of this <hi>multiplice Scheme</hi> is to be; there muſt be the Trunk or Body of this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and that hath its <hi>feet</hi> of many Nations and People ſpread far and wide, the People of the Ten Horns, like the <hi>feet</hi> of a <hi>Bear,</hi> and by thoſe many ſorts of People, its Body is variouſly ſpotted about like a <hi>Leopard;</hi> this is the Populacy with their ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Magiſtrates. There are the <hi>ſeven Heads,</hi> or ſupreme crowned Authorities, each having ſucceſſive Dignity and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, as the <hi>Romans</hi> had <hi>Kings, Conſuls, Decemvirs, Tribunes of the People, perpetual Dictators,</hi> all fallen in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Time, and ſo they ſignifie no farther than the making a Character of the <hi>Monarchy</hi> intended. In the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Time were the <hi>Emperours,</hi> or the <hi>Dragon</hi> in the <hi>Language</hi> of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,</hi> and the <hi>ſixth Head;</hi> and the Beaſt, the ſeventh and laſt, whoſe Mouth ſpeaking as the <hi>Lyon, Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> acts the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Feet</hi> to the Cruelty of the <hi>Leopard,</hi> and <hi>Bear</hi> by his <hi>idolatrous</hi> and <hi>fiery Decrees.</hi> There are the <hi>ten crowned Horns,</hi> whoſe Scite is in this <hi>Head,</hi> abſolute, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant <hi>Monarchs</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> only as <hi>they agree to give their Strength and Power to the Beast.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now all theſe have ſo cloſe an Union with the <hi>Grand Beast,</hi> that the Body is ſo his, that he is the <hi>Beast,</hi> becauſe he is the <hi>Head</hi> of the Body; the <hi>ten Horns</hi> are his while they are <hi>Horns,</hi> for their Situation muſt be in the <hi>Head:</hi> the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Heads</hi> are his, the <hi>five fallen</hi> to make him a Character; the <hi>ſixth,</hi> the <hi>Imperial Dragon,</hi> lives in him, is <hi>worſhipped in</hi> him, continues to the laſt in him, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Monarchickneſs,</hi> the <hi>Idolatry,</hi> the Enmity to <hi>Chriſt's Kingdom</hi> eſpecially, even as he at the firſt is <hi>wounded</hi> in him. And the <hi>other Beast</hi> is his, negotiating his Dignity and Supremacy, and at that compleat, ſubſiding into his <hi>Falſe Prophet;</hi> the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>Beast,</hi> the <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi> ſending out, each the <hi>Spirit of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils;</hi> and the <hi>Falſe Prophet, taken</hi> as inſeparable one from the other, <hi>with him,</hi> and <hi>caſt into the Lake.</hi> Thus he is every way the grand <hi>Apocalyptick Beaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:41903:105"/>
                  <p> Having laid this Foundation by way of Premiſal, I come now to define this <hi>Grand Apocalyptick Beaſt,</hi> according to his certain, eſſential, invariable Characters, moſt eminent in <hi>Prophecy,</hi> moſt conſpicuous in <hi>History:</hi> for I dare not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture ſo great a weight on <hi>Hiſtory</hi> without <hi>Prophecy,</hi> nor ſuſpend it on my Interpretation of <hi>Prophecy</hi> without obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Divine Providence, conducting the Event at every ſwelling Period, into moſt undoubted <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> When both meet to ſuch Perfection, it is hard to doubt, and even ſullen Obſtinacy to deny.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Beaſt</hi> muſt be the Apoſtle <hi>John's Great Antichriſt, that</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now this can be no way ſo effectually done, as by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be the <hi>Vicar of Chriſt,</hi> and holding his Kingdom in his Right, and as in Honour of him. And he that does that, is the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:41903:110"/>
                  <p> The Judgment of God upon the <hi>apoſtatiz'd Chriſtian Empire,</hi> made way for him to riſe to a <hi>ſupreme Apoſtate.</hi> God <hi>took away</hi> that <hi>apoſtatiz'd indeed Imperial King,</hi> but no <hi>Head,</hi> and gave the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> a proper both <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>King</hi> in his Wrath.</p>
                  <p>But he was at this time, and long after, a <hi>Beast,</hi> that <hi>Was</hi> and yet <hi>Is not.</hi> There being therefore no other Name of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and <hi>Auguſtneſs, Rome,</hi> the Abſolute <hi>Rome,</hi> (for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> was but a mutuatitious <hi>Rome,</hi> it borrowed in Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation the Name, <hi>Rome</hi> only;) becauſe, I ſay, there was no other Name but that of the <hi>Beſtian</hi> Succeſſion, in the time when he was under the Inſcription, <hi>Is not; Rome</hi> was very <hi>dark.</hi> All other Names, not only of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> but even of <hi>Subordinacy,</hi> by degrees were ecclips'd; yea, the Ecclipſe was total, 'ere the Light returned: no <hi>Emperour,</hi> no <hi>Senate,</hi> no <hi>Kings,</hi> under the Denomination of <hi>Rome,</hi> no <hi>Conſuls.</hi> And <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf became a <hi>Provincial City</hi> under the <hi>Exar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chat</hi> of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> as low a State as the Miſtreſs of the World could be depreſs'd into; more inglorious than an utter Extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Thus it was from 475 beginning, to about 550, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperour. Herein all Hiſtory is at Peace, at one with it ſelf: and ſo things continued ſome time.</p>
                  <p>And how elegantly does <hi>Prophecy</hi> repreſent this under the ſymbolical Account of the <hi>fourth Trumpet! The fourth Angel ſounded,</hi> and <hi>the third part of the Sun,</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and of the <hi>Stars, were ſmitten;</hi> and <hi>the Day ſhined not for a third part thereof,</hi> and the Night likewiſe. The <hi>Beſtian</hi> Name being as yet in a Peerage, and out of that very Peerage to come in an <hi>Image</hi> into its luſtre, (and the Image not yet made) could not inlighten this great Orb; for its Name however, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Name of Supremacy, was not yet known in its <hi>Beſtian Supremacy,</hi> but was yet as of another Order and Claim.</p>
                  <p>But now at the end of the <hi>fourth,</hi> and in the beginning of the <hi>fifth Trumpet,</hi> it began to dawn; and ſo Prophecy will by its Dawn convey us upon this Line, this wonderful Line, we have diſcourſed ſo long upon, the Line of the 1260 Days; with which the <hi>forty two Months</hi> of the <hi>Beast</hi> are now
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41903:111"/> combin'd. <hi>Prophecy</hi> will, I ſay, very ſpeedily in the <hi>fifth Trumpet</hi> convey and ſet us upon a new Line of the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Hegira</hi> or Computation of Time; ſo that we ſhall run upon it for the ſpace of eight hundred and thirty Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with the 1260 Days, and with the <hi>Beſtian</hi> Line, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending in ſhort the moſt <hi>Oecumenical</hi> and illuſtrious Points of Hiſtory at that Time in the Univerſe; <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Beſtian</hi> and the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Graſſation, or Invaſion into the ſame kind of Univerſal Power; and both upon the Account of <hi>Pſeudo-Prophetiſm,</hi> the due Obſervation of which, will perſuade us of the Divineneſs of this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and that we are upon the true Explication of it.</p>
                  <p>As it were then, between the ending of the Time of the <hi>fourth,</hi> and the beginning of the Time of the <hi>fifth Trumpet;</hi> there was a loud Voice, as of an Angels flying through the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that upper Region, like the Voice of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, reaching down to the Earth, and ſaying, <hi>Woe, Woe, Woe,</hi> to the <hi>Inhabiters of the Earth,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Voices</hi> of the <hi>Angels</hi> that are yet to <hi>ſound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it were wonderful, if merely by the chance of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, running ſuch a Path, ſo great and remarkable Configurations both of <hi>Prophecy</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory</hi> ſhould meet it ſo often, juſt where it would chooſe and deſire to be ſo met.</p>
                  <p>For at this very Time, <hi>Gregory</hi> call'd the <hi>Great, Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> a Perſonage of ſo great Eminence for Vertue, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Eloquence, declar'd aloud in his <hi>Epiſtles</hi> to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Mauricius,</hi> and to <hi>John</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">So alſo to the Biſhops of <hi>Alexand.</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och.</hi>
                     </note> That <hi>Antichrist</hi> was near; That the Title of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhop</hi> was a certain Indication of him; That it was Pride to aſſume ſuch a Title; It was like <hi>Lucifer, Son of the Morning, aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heights of the Stars,</hi> ſetting his Throne above the other <hi>Angels,</hi> above the other <hi>Stars,</hi> affecting to be <hi>like the Most High.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing no ſuch could be fix'd in the <hi>Firmament</hi> or <hi>Heaven</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> he muſt needs <hi>Fall:</hi> How cloſe then is

                  <p>Juſt as when <hi>Satan fell from Heaven</hi> he had a Kingdom aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd him by the Divine Permiſſion and Decree; <hi>viz.

                  <p>This <hi>Fall</hi> then of this <hi>Star,</hi> is like the <hi>Angels leaving their own Habitation,</hi> their <hi>first Eſtate,</hi> or <hi>true original Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>

                  <p>It is true, the <hi>Beaſt</hi> had been in his <hi>forty two months</hi> above a hundred Years; yet, as a Tyrant, prophetically declar'd to be a Tyrant, is not yet ſo in his Infancy or Under-ſtate, no more than <hi>Hazael</hi> was a Tyrant when <hi>Eliſha</hi> told him what <note place="margin">1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8. 11.</note> he, as ſuch a Tyrant, ſhould do; no more was the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſuch a <hi>Beaſt</hi> while he was under the Inſcription, <hi>Is not.</hi> So that though he was a <hi>Beaſt</hi> by way of Succeſſion, and ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſagious Actions, He might yet not be a <hi>falling Star</hi> till he now <hi>fell,</hi> and receiv'd this <hi>Key:</hi> for the whole <hi>Beſtian</hi> Body, or Succeſſion, is conſider'd in the whole <hi>Beaſt,</hi> not in its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ages, nor in the ſingle Perſons making it, ſome better ſome worſe: all that enter its Compoſition, are conſider'd as one <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the <hi>prophetick Scheme,</hi> in any <hi>Age,</hi> in any <hi>Beſtian</hi> Qualities, more or leſs; yea though ſo moderate, as that they ſhould only bear up the Title, and maintain the Succeſſion. And this removes all poſſible Objection; as thus, Was he,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41903:112"/> that had been a <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſo long, a <hi>Star</hi> yet to <hi>Fall?</hi> You ſee, he might be ſo while he was the <hi>Beast; Is not;</hi> and yet not a <hi>falling Star;</hi> for this <hi>fall</hi> prepar'd his <hi>riſing out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit,</hi> and ſo to ſhew himſelf a Beaſt, whereas yet he could not appear ſo, but muſt remain in his State, <hi>Is not,</hi> till this <hi>fall,</hi> and after it too, even till he came to his <hi>number,</hi> that <hi>Prophecy</hi> might be <hi>fulfilled,</hi> when he <hi>aſcends</hi> out of this <hi>Abyſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And though his <hi>fall</hi> was but to the <hi>Earth,</hi> yet becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the <hi>Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> he pretended to, he had only the <hi>Key of the bottomleſs Pit,</hi> he is juſtly ſaid to <hi>riſe</hi> out of it, for that he <hi>aſcended,</hi> what was it, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle argues in a much better Caſe, but that he <hi>deſcended</hi> firſt; <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>I confeſs, <hi>The Patriark of Constantinople</hi> was the Firſt in this Aſſumption, the Emulation of which mov'd <hi>Gregory,</hi> it is to be fear'd, as a lower cauſe to ſo high an Exclamation; but though he was Firſt, yet he was not to have the <hi>Key of the Abyſs</hi> in Supremacy; for <hi>Prophecy ſees not as Man ſees</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and as in parcels, but at once; it therefore calls him, <hi>that fallen Star</hi> alone, who was to have this <hi>Key,</hi> although the other was a <hi>falling Star</hi> alſo, and ſpake as a <hi>Dragon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is then, and he alone, He that hath under Sathan the <hi>Key of the bottomleſs Pit,</hi> and though an <hi>Angel</hi> is call'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Angel of the bottomleſs Pit,</hi> whom we ſhall find in its due place very diverſe from this <hi>Star,</hi> who may ſeem to have a better right to this <hi>Key;</hi> we ſhall yet find he was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>He, that aſcends out of the <hi>bottomleſs Pit,</hi> is he that <hi>open'd</hi> it, and <hi>let out the Smoke,</hi> he <hi>opens it,</hi> he <hi>lets out the Smoke,</hi> out of which the <hi>Locuſts</hi> came, but againſt his own Intention, he intended himſelf to ride in this <hi>Cloud,</hi> as in an <hi>infernal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot</hi> alone; but with the Smoke <hi>Sathan</hi> alſo <hi>aſcended,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an <hi>Angel of the bottomleſs Pit in the King of the Locuſts,</hi> who were the <hi>Flood out of his Mouth,</hi> propagating his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by both the <hi>Star,</hi> and by the <hi>King of the Locusts;</hi> The latter of which was principally a great Judgment of God on the <hi>Antichristian Star,</hi> as ſhall be ſhewn at large.</p>
                  <p>In the mean Time we find, the <hi>other Beaſt</hi> miniſtring to this delivery of <hi>the Key of the bottomleſs Pit,</hi> under the decree and judicial Ordination of God. For they made Trial for him, of the Efficacy of the <hi>Lamb-like Horns,</hi> joyn'd with the <hi>dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conick Idolatry,</hi> and Perſecution, and ſo exercis'd the <hi>Power of the firſt Beaſt before him,</hi> while he, as one, and the chief <note place="margin">

They eſſayed the <hi>calling fire from Heaven,</hi> and <hi>working lying Miracles</hi> in his ſight, to eſtabliſh the Grandeur of <hi>falſe Prophecy;</hi> they ſtirred up all to <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the firſt Beaſt, viz.

                  </p>
                  <p>And even the <hi>Eaſtern Horn</hi> that aſpired for it ſelf above this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> yet by approving the <hi>Idea,</hi> by making the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by aſſuming the Title, provok'd and inkindled the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of him, who by the divine Decree had the Permiſſion, got the Poſſeſſion, and hath for many Ages wedg'd himſelf faſt into it, and left the <hi>other Horn</hi> leiſure only to be angry at his defeat, while his vain claim juſtifies the thing as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and deſirable; and therefore gave the occaſion to the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41903:113"/> 
                     <hi>High ſounding Voice of</hi> Gregory <hi>the Great.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is very obſervable, on this very account the Divine Juſtice fell all along ſeverely upon the <hi>Eaſtern Empire,</hi> and <hi>Patriarchate,</hi> by the <hi>two first woe-Trumpets,</hi> eſpecially at the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and to this day lies heavy upon them: ſo that as the <hi>Grecian Emperours</hi> gave firſt to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinopolitan Patriarch,</hi> and then to the <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> this <hi>Antichriſtian <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality;</hi> ſo moſt diſtinctly the Wrath of God was very dreadful upon both the <hi>Empire,</hi> and the whole <hi>Hierarchy</hi> as ſo <hi>antichriſtianizing;</hi> and ſo it continues, and will ſo far conjoyn them in the Puniſhment of the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> as they ſhall not divorce themſelves from them by Repentance.</p>
                  <p>For this <hi>Prophecy</hi> looks upon both the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern Hierarchy,</hi> as one and the ſame <hi>Beast</hi> with <hi>two Horns,</hi> under the ſame <hi>grand Beast,</hi> and their People, as one <hi>Body of Men, Gentiles, Inhabitants of the Antichriſtian Earth,</hi> and <hi>Sea,</hi> and as <hi>two Wings of the ſame Eagle.</hi> And they all along are both puniſh'd in, and with one another. 'Tis not the leſſer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies among themſelves concerning <hi>Primacy,</hi> or ſome other matters, that can diſſolve the <hi>Antichriſtian <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> wherein this <hi>Prophecy</hi> leaves them; it muſt be ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, turning from <hi>Idolatry, Superſtition,</hi> Enmity to the pure Religion; and from Pride and Tyranny, enjoyed only by one, one of the <hi>Horns</hi> indeed for many years as moſt near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allied to the <hi>Grand Beaſt,</hi> but affected by both, that muſt make that <hi>Wall of Partition,</hi> that hath not yet been made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern Antichriſtians,</hi> or between any parts of each and their <hi>Antichriſtianiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Interim</hi> from this very Time we are upon, the <hi>Beast, falling</hi> as <hi>a Star</hi> to the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Earth, receives, as <hi>Latin,</hi> that is, ſtrictly <hi>Roman,</hi> the Univerſality of both <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> as was always deſign'd by God to be ſo given or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and ſo by degrees enlightens <hi>Rome,</hi> when all the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> of the <hi>Day,</hi> and even of the <hi>Night,</hi> were <hi>ſmitten,</hi> gone down, and ſet; and now he begins to carry the <hi>Woman</hi> on
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41903:114"/> high, even at his firſt <hi>aſcending,</hi> and ſo gradually as he <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends</hi> to his <hi>Number.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hereby the <hi>fallen Star</hi> appears to be the ſame <hi>Beast</hi> that <hi>riſes out of the bottomleſs Pit,</hi> to <hi>war with the Witneſſes;</hi> and therefore muſt be the ſame that <hi>wars</hi> with the Saints, who are the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and who is <hi>led captive</hi> or <hi>taken</hi> by the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and his Army of the <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>goes into Perdition;</hi> that is, is <hi>cast into the Lake:</hi> and ſo the ſame throughout.</p>
                  <p>And when he is ſo <hi>caſt into the Lake,</hi> an Angel of another Character does not <hi>fall,</hi> but <hi>deſcends</hi> from <hi>Heaven, having the Key</hi> of the <hi>bottomleſs Pit</hi> not judicially <hi>given,</hi> but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him; not to <hi>open</hi> the <hi>bottomleſs Pit,</hi> and <hi>let out the Smoak;</hi> not to <hi>looſe</hi> nor <hi>draw</hi> out at greater liberty, and by provoking God to give the Malice of Devils greater ſcope, by the <hi>Angel</hi> of that <hi>Pit, raging like a roaring Lyon,</hi> in a <hi>hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Mahometaniſm;</hi> but to <hi>lay hold on him, to bind him, to cast him into the bottomleſs Pit,</hi> to <hi>ſhut him up,</hi> and to <hi>ſet a Seal upon him,</hi> that he may <hi>deceive the Nations no more</hi> for <hi>the</hi> 1000 <hi>Years:</hi> which very Conſideration of that ſo oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite <hi>Viſion</hi> does much inlighten this of the <hi>fifth Trumpet</hi> we are now upon.</p>
                  <p>It remains, that we conſider now, what the Service of the <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> might at this time moſt agreeably with <hi>Prophecy</hi> be; and as ſo conſidering it, I look upon this joynt of Time, this Proclamation of the <hi>three woe Trumpets,</hi> to be the very entrance of the Witneſſes in the ſecond Type of that eminent Binary, or Pair of <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and <hi>Prophets, Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Witneſſes</hi> had now a long time, as <hi>the Sons of Oyl, emptied their golden Oyl</hi> by way of preparatory Furniture of thoſe two <hi>golden Candleſticks,</hi> the <hi>true Churches of Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatyra,</hi> that <hi>ſtood,</hi> this whole Line of Time, <hi>before the God of the whole Earth;</hi> and though we have not the clear and unmixed Records of any ſuch Teſtimony; for that were to leſſen the <hi>Prophecy;</hi> beſides that the Indignation of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41903:114"/> 
                     <hi>Apoſtate Church</hi> muſt needs have ſuppreſs'd them: they muſt needs have ſuffer'd more ſo than under the Injuries of Time: but I ſay it were to leſſen <hi>Prophecy,</hi> which ſays, They were <hi>cover'd with Sackcloth,</hi> they were <hi>ſeal'd,</hi> they were retir'd within the <hi>Temple,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> was in the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> through the <hi>ſcattering of its Seed.</hi> It is not then poſſible, according to the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> there ſhould be pure, liquid Remains of their <hi>Teſtimony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now the <hi>Antichriſtians,</hi> like <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah,</hi> and other the Enemies of the <hi>Jews,</hi> diſturb'd their Service, and in building with them hinder'd the Operation, and infus'd their Venome in ſome part into the Writings and Diſcourſes of Perſons of a much more excellent temper in the main.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> therefore, as we may in part ſee by <hi>Gregory</hi> (praiſed before) paſſed into the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power of Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha;</hi> they began now to <hi>have fire proceed out of their Mouths, to devour their Adverſaries;</hi> They began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Wrath of God againſt <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian Pride,</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy:</hi> And this entred as <hi>Fire</hi> into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of their <hi>Enemies,</hi> that in <hi>this manner they were kill'd,</hi> as it were by the <hi>Sword of Chriſt's Mouth,</hi> which he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens to the <hi>Balamites</hi> in the <hi>Church of Pergamus;</hi> and herein they imitated the Zeal of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Phincas</hi> againſt the <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Fornication</hi> and <hi>Nicolaitaniſm</hi> of that time; and alſo prepar'd the Servants of God in <hi>Thyatyra</hi> with a holy Zeal againſt the <hi>Jezebeliſm,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>Fornication</hi> of that Time alſo, when the Apoſtacy was increas'd.</p>
                  <p>But how can we hope for much of Monument hereof? The <hi>Prophecy</hi> of <hi>Gregory</hi> is more than we could expect; and were it not that he ſerv'd the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> to many other great purpoſes, we had not had ſo much of him; but God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul'd ſo far. Now the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> were coming into the cloſeſt time of being <hi>ſeal'd;</hi> and therefore we have the mention of it reviv'd within the <hi>fifth Trumpet;</hi> They were <hi>ſed with hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Manna,</hi> They were hardly known one to another at the very Time; <hi>Elijah</hi> knew not of the <hi>ſeven thouſand Knees</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:41903:115"/> that had not <hi>bowed to Baal,</hi> nor their <hi>Mouths kiſs'd him,</hi> but thought himſelf <hi>alone:</hi> How much leſs then can we now know them?</p>
                  <p>And which is very characteriſtical of this Period of the <hi>Witneſſes Prophecy</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony;</hi> They have Power to <hi>ſhut Heaven,</hi> that it <hi>rain not in the Days of their Prophecy;</hi> ſo that there ariſes a <hi>Famine,</hi> not of <hi>Bread,</hi> but <hi>of hearing the Word of the Lord:</hi> and this endured for the intimate Time, of which we are to ſpeak in the next Period of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and the Remark of <hi>ſhutting Heaven</hi> for <hi>three Years</hi> and <hi>ſix Months</hi> will be of great Conduct to us.</p>

                  <p>The Diſtribution of their dreadful Effects to a <hi>five months of Torment</hi> upon men, like the <hi>ſtroke</hi> of a <hi>Scorpion,</hi> while it was <hi>a vexation to underſtand the Report;</hi> we ſuppoſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> was their firſt invading the World in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and hovering over the <hi>Apoſtate Kingdom.</hi> The ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Succeſs was ſo prodigious, that it could not but be thought, that the <hi>Lord uttered his Voice before his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;</hi> and that as his <hi>Camp</hi> was <hi>very great,</hi> ſo he was <hi>ſtrong</hi> that <hi>executed his Word,</hi> that the <hi>Day of the Lord was very terrible,</hi> and <hi>none could abide it:</hi> before their <hi>Face all People were much pained,</hi> and <hi>all Faces gather'd Blackneſs.</hi> The <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Tidings of their Victories and Succeſſes</hi> was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually <hi>tormented,</hi> as with <hi>Job's Meſſengers,</hi> or with the <hi>ſtroak of a Scorpion,</hi> a not being <hi>kill'd,</hi> but a living in pain.</p>
                  <p>But when this Army drew nearer into <hi>Italy,</hi> and even to <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, in the ſecond <hi>five Months;</hi> when it enter'd the very <hi>Gates of that great City,</hi> they ran <hi>up the Walls,</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in at the Windows</hi> to pillage and plunder, and were alſo perpetually <hi>ſtriking</hi> with the <hi>Tails</hi> of not only their falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but in Contempt and Scorn of the <hi>Antichristian Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> and <hi>Image-worſhip:</hi> it was worſe than a <hi>ſpeedy Death,</hi> or a <hi>total Conquest,</hi> the <hi>prophetical</hi> Death here intended, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when it came to cruel Slavery.</p>
                  <p>It was no wonder then, <hi>men ſought for Death,</hi> that is, a quiet State, although of being <hi>conquered,</hi> and in Subjection, and could not <hi>find</hi> it, <hi>it fled from them;</hi> for God had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd them this <hi>lingring Torment,</hi> and not a <hi>ſpeedy Death</hi> or <hi>Conqueſt</hi> over them; and even <hi>theſe Locuſts</hi> could do no more than what was <hi>commanded them</hi> and <hi>given to them.</hi> Now
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41903:118"/> their Power the five <hi>ſecond Months</hi> was more than the <hi>first;</hi> it was not only to <hi>torment</hi> with their terrour and report, but to <hi>hurt</hi> with a real Preſence; but it was only to <hi>hurt,</hi> and not to <hi>kill,</hi> (as the <hi>Turkiſh Cavalry</hi> was to do at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;)</hi> ſo they could do no more than <hi>hurt,</hi> they could not <hi>kill:</hi> the <hi>Beſtian Rome</hi> and <hi>Empire</hi> were to ſurvive them.</p>
                  <p>Thus they had <hi>five Months,</hi> and <hi>five Months</hi> of Action, eminent grand Action; but ſeeing they had the ſpace of <hi>five Months</hi> more in their Fourhundred and thirty years, they muſt be ſuppos'd to come out of a firſt Formation, and rude Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations; or to be at a diſtance from the effects of <hi>Torment</hi> and <hi>Hurt</hi> upon the <hi>unſealed, Anticbriſtian,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Weſtern</hi> State: And at their latter end of Power a winterly Torpor and Deadneſs ſeis'd them, and the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Power drove them into a <hi>deſolate Land,</hi> and their <hi>ſtink,</hi> as of an Army of <hi>dead Serpents,</hi> came up, that yet in their Time <hi>had done great things;</hi> and ſo is their Memory at this day.

The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> aſſures us, <hi>Antichrist</hi> was then <hi>in the World,</hi> and the ſupreme <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptes,</hi> Chriſt, tells us, <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtolical Church,</hi> had even in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Times <hi>left</hi> its <hi>first Love;</hi> when therefore <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Time had doubled it ſelf from <hi>Twelve</hi> to <hi>Twenty Four,</hi> and was moving onward, as at a preciſe Time from Conception; the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to work at 25 or 26.</p>
                  <p>And it is no wonder, the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> beheld by the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in Spirit,</hi> when no Eye ſaw him in this his <hi>Embrional</hi> Condition in his firſt Principles, was thus remark'd by him; For then every thing receives its nature; Even as <hi>Jacob</hi> in the <hi>Womb,</hi> as <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> as <hi>our Lord</hi> in his <hi>Conception</hi> is celebrated; ſo <hi>this Man of Sin</hi> is dated from the <hi>conceiving</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> as well as from the <hi>manly State,</hi> from the <hi>Conception</hi> as well as from the <hi>grown Man,</hi> till then Iniquity fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing its Time <hi>brings forth Death.</hi> This <hi>Pſendo Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamite,</hi> this <hi>ſpiritual Edom,</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſtruggled as another <hi>Nation</hi> in the Womb of the <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> while the pure <hi>Iſraeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, without guile,</hi> lay in the <hi>Womb</hi> of <hi>true Chriſtianity;</hi> to both which, the outward Profeſſion was a <hi>common Womb.</hi> This <hi>prophane Eſau</hi> is he that <hi>ſold the Birth-right of the Goſpel for a Meſs oſ Pottage,</hi> and the <hi>Heavenly Kingdom</hi> for an <hi>Earthly Dukedom;</hi> and wherein he got the ſtart.</p>

                  <p>I do not intend to purſue this Paralel too cloſe, or too minutely, nor to rely too hard on <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> to give the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of time exactly enough; but I reſt ſecurely on <hi>Prophecy,</hi> that there was a ſufficient agreement between that and the Event, at every juſt Time; The Idolatry and Tyranny, or Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> was <hi>riſen</hi> by the <hi>Morning</hi> of the <hi>ſecond</hi> 180, of the <hi>first</hi> 360, about 617, eleven years after the <hi>

Between the <hi>two Evenings,</hi> or within the <hi>laſt fourth part, viz.</hi> 787, at
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41903:123"/> the <hi>ſecond Councel of</hi> Nice, the <hi>Beaſt overcame,</hi> the <hi>Witneſſes were ſlain,</hi> and ſo <hi>they lay dead</hi> for two whole Days, or twice 360 years, till 1517; when after the <hi>half day</hi> begun, The firſt motion to a <hi>Reſurrection</hi> manifeſted it ſelf, which could not be till they had continued <hi>dead</hi> ſuch a <hi>part</hi> of this <hi>laſt half day,</hi> as ſuffic'd to fulfill the <hi>Prophecy,</hi> that ſays, <hi>their dead Bodies ſhould lye three days and a half in the ſtreet of the great City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And without laying too much weight upon Particles of Time, it is out of meaſure certain, the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> the <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> of the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> within due di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the time ſignified by this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and of which <hi>Hiſtory</hi> near enough to Time, gives ſome very remarkable <hi>watch-word,</hi> or rather <hi>loud Voice,</hi> were at an elevation every way adequate to the <hi>ſuffering, dying ſtate of the Witneſſes,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Predictions,</hi> that went before, concerning both, in this <hi>Symbol</hi> or <hi>Exemplar</hi> of that <hi>great Proto-Martyr,</hi> the <hi>chief</hi> and <hi>ſupream Witneſs,</hi> the <hi>faithful Martyr, Jeſus Christ,</hi> and thoſe Gradations or Steps of his <hi>dying,</hi> and <hi>riſing again,</hi> ſo exactly meaſured out in time within his <hi>three days,</hi> and their <hi>three days and a half;</hi> abating only for the difference of the Paralels, our <hi>Lord</hi> was <hi>buried,</hi> they were not to be ſo, as we ſhall preſently obſerve.</p>
                  <p>Now for the further proving theſe things, I thus Argue.</p>
                  <p>Whenever the <hi>Beaſts Name,</hi> and the <hi>number of his Name</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>1</label> the <hi>Receiving the Name,</hi> and the <hi>number of the Name began alſo;</hi> For theſe are ſo eſſentially joyned together, as not to be divided, and indeed the <hi>Name</hi> and the <hi>Number</hi> do not come into Record, but for the receivings ſake of them, and then the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of the <hi>Image,</hi> the <hi>receiving a Mark in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> or the <hi>right Hand,</hi> began alſo. For all theſe are here of equivalent Satisfaction to the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and they are all along through the <hi>after Prophecy</hi> joyn'd, as of equal Guilt, Sin and Danger; however then, they may denote ſeveral Poſts and Stations in the ſervice of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> as it is indeed a great and wonderful Court, and hath a moſt ſtupendious diverſity
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41903:124"/> of Offices, Miniſtrations, Subordinations, and Dependencies, and as vaſt a Populace; yet all theſe ſpeak the ſame Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Subjection, Vaſſalage, to the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in one kind or other; and therefore the Priviledge of thoſe who abjure any of theſe, as therein abjuring all, is allowed equal by Chriſt: ſo that they are all indifferently and promiſcuouſly by this Prophecy uſed in all Caſes, as we may ſee. If then the <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>Name,</hi> co-eval with the <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> was at 725, all the reſt muſt be alſo at that Time. Seeing then it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent All muſt begin together; If by Evidence from <hi>Hiſtory</hi> one was at 725, or as between 725 and 726, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude All the reſt were ſo too.</p>
                  <p>But that one was, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of the <hi>Image,</hi> we have that ſo illuſtrious <hi>Icono-Claſtick Hiſtory,</hi> at that Time. Now beſides the force of the Alluſion between <hi>Worſhip</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> and the <hi>worſhipping</hi> the <hi>Beaſts Image;</hi> if we examine it well, we ſhall find both united.</p>
                  <p>For as in the <hi>worſhip</hi> of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's Image,</hi> to which pattern the <hi>Prophecy</hi> undoubtedly refers, It ſeems the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of an <hi>Image</hi> made to his <hi>Glory,</hi> even of that <hi>Image</hi> he ſaw in a <hi>Dream,</hi> of which he was the <hi>Head of Gold;</hi> or however moſt certainly, his <hi>univerſal</hi> Power, and <hi>Monarchy</hi> commanding all Nations was celebrated by the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of the <hi>Image,</hi> he had made; and therefore the <hi>Edict</hi> runs in that <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial</hi> Style; Unto you it is <hi>commanded, O People, Nations, Tongues,</hi> and <hi>Languages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But beſides this, The <hi>worſhipping</hi> this <hi>Image</hi> is call'd both by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> himſelf, and by the <hi>Servants</hi> of the <hi>true</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Even thus, <hi>The worſhipping the Image made to the Beaſt</hi> was both a Worſhip of the Beaſt as part of that old Image made up of Idolatry and Tyranny, a Worſhip of his Univerſal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, commanding Nations, Tongues, and People, and alſo juſtly call'd a <hi>Worſhip of his Gods,</hi> repreſented by <hi>Images;</hi> As <hi>worſhipping his Image,</hi> in the laſt Time of the <hi>fourth Beast</hi> or <hi>Monarchy,</hi> gives ſo ſignificant an Alluſion to the <hi>Worſhip of</hi>

                  <p>And in that theſe <hi>Emperours</hi> were out of <hi>Rome's Dioceſe</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> it was a ſtyle like that, <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And if things were thus with ſo great Perſonages as <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,</hi> how muſt they prevail in general upon <hi>Nations, Tongues,</hi> and <hi>Languages</hi> of an inferiour Character, and what muſt the Rage be againſt them?</p>

                  <p>But the 144000 <hi>ſealed,</hi> who had not <hi>defiled themſelves</hi> with <hi>Women,</hi> of a <hi>Virgin-worſhip,</hi> and obedience to the <hi>Lamb,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the <hi>Beast</hi> and his <hi>Woman of Fornications,</hi> he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; <hi>The Seed,</hi> who <hi>keep the Commandments of God,</hi> and <hi>hold the Teſtimony of Jeſus;</hi> The <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Holy Worſhippers</hi> in the <hi>Temple</hi> muſt certainly remonſtrate to this <hi>Idolatrous Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,</hi> and abominate it: They are thoſe, who neither <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd the Beast,</hi> nor his <hi>Image,</hi> nor <hi>receiv'd his Mark, Name,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And this, according to the known Blaſt of <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> was both a <hi>religious,</hi> a <hi>civil,</hi> and alſo a <hi>natural Death,</hi> as often as the <hi>Tyranny of the Beast</hi> could make it ſo.

                  <p>But tho' they <hi>died,</hi> As their <hi>Lord</hi> did, they could not, as he, be <hi>buried:</hi> His Death was to be ſo aſſur'd by <hi>Burial;</hi> but theſe <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> being a <hi>ſucceſſive Body,</hi> were to continue <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>prophecying,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> did at his <hi>Death, viz.</hi> in their continual <hi>Succeſſions: Part of this first day, the whole two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing days,</hi> or twice 360 <hi>Years,</hi> joyn'd therefore as <hi>two Times,</hi> till within 1517, the <hi>last half day,</hi> or 180 <hi>Years;</hi> then the firſt motion to a <hi>Reſurrection</hi> began, and could not begin ſooner. So that when that <hi>Reſurrection began,</hi> we may know aſſuredly, Intimate Time was expir'd. The laſt 180 Years, on which it was to make an Impreſſion, was come, and that therefore the twice 360 <hi>days</hi> were paſt, or the <hi>two Times;</hi> and that ſome part of the firſt 360 <hi>days</hi> or <hi>first Time,</hi> had alſo paſt, ſince <hi>Intimate Time</hi> began, ſo as to come from thence forward to 1517, and ſo to 1697; which is the Period to be prov'd.</p>
                  <p>Till that 1517 then, <hi>They lay dead</hi> in the <hi>Street,</hi> or <hi>Breadth</hi> of that <hi>Great City,</hi> which extended it ſelf over <hi>Nations, Tongues, People,</hi> as the <hi>old City Rome</hi> did.

                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:41903:126"/>
                  <p> And to ſhew when it began, Prophecy, beſides <hi>killing,</hi> makes uſe of the Propriety of the <hi>Interdict, Proſcription,</hi> or <hi>Outlawry of Excommunication;</hi> That none ſhould <hi>buy</hi> or <hi>ſell</hi> who did not <hi>receive,</hi> &amp;c. whether <hi>Great,</hi> Rich, or Free, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>Emperours,</hi> on whom the <hi>Interdict</hi> ſo conſpicuouſly fell; then on <hi>Small, Poor, Bond,</hi> ſignifying the <hi>univerſal Death</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> by the extent of the <hi>Nicean Anathema's</hi> at 787. All which is ſo clear a notice of the Time, that one would think it impoſſible to be denied.</p>
                  <p>Now that the <hi>Beast</hi> might be every way mounted to the height, to compleat his Number 666 at 725 or 26; and that the Divine <hi>Prophecy</hi> is cautious in not ſetting it too haſtily, may be eaſily believ'd, when we conſider the early aſpirings of the <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> who before the Year 200, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie concerning the time of celebrating <hi>Eaſter,</hi> had by <hi>Victor,</hi> otherwiſe a good man, and <hi>Martyr,</hi> by way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage began to mannage the Key of the bottomleſs Pit in the <hi>Excommunication</hi> of the Eaſtern Churches; or if we conſider what Accounts <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> a grave <hi>Heathen</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian in the Time of <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> about 360, gives of the State and Grandeur of that <hi>Biſhop</hi> in his Time; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that he does profeſs the ſecular Glory, Richeſs, and Splendour of it might tempt him to embrace Chriſtianity, if that <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> might be the Reward of his Converſion. And although this Greatneſs muſt needs in the calamitous State of <hi>Rome</hi> be much depreſs'd; yet it is plain, it waited all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of lifting up its Head, and at this Time to that height, that by infallible Judgment of this <hi>Prophecy, the Beaſt</hi> was come to <hi>his Number</hi> at 725.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude this matter; from all that hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of this <hi>Number,</hi> It cannot except by accident predict the end of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> Time; for however that Denunciation, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 9. intimates the poſſibility of worſhipping the <hi>Beast,</hi> and his <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>receiving his Mark; viz.</hi> by impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Perſeverance in that <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> even after not only his <hi>intimate Time</hi> expir'd, but even after the end of his 1260
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:41903:126"/> Days, as I expound that <hi>Voice of the Angel;</hi> yet it is not to be ſuppos'd, that the Holy Spirit would give the <hi>Number of the Name</hi> that was to be <hi>receiv'd</hi> as a <hi>Teſt</hi> of Subjection to the <hi>Beast,</hi> as a <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> of his End: For what ſervice were it to the <hi>Beast,</hi> or what diſhonour to Chriſt, to carry the <hi>Hieroglyphick of the Time</hi> God had determin'd to the <hi>Beast's</hi> Deſtruction? Seeing <hi>the Mark, the Name, the Number of the Name,</hi> and of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> are, as hath been declar'd, all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially wreath'd and wrought one into another, and import cloſe and deep Subjection to the <hi>Beaſt.</hi>

                  <p>As then the <hi>Seducements</hi> of a <hi>ſpiritual Jezebel,</hi> that <hi>maketh her ſelf a Propheteſs,</hi> led away thoſe, that by the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Christ</hi> ſhould be his <hi>Servants,</hi> to <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> even ſo the ſame <hi>Jezebel, Rev.</hi> 17. is plainly declar'd as in the <hi>Church of Thyatyra;</hi> ſo the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> contemporary with <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 20.</note> this <hi>Jezebel</hi> have a <hi>power to ſhut Heaven</hi> that it ſhould not <hi>rain</hi> in the <hi>twelve hundred ſixty Days</hi> of their <hi>Prophecy,</hi> but at <hi>their Word.</hi>

                  <p>But then, as we have ſhewed, <hi>Elijah's three Years and ſix Months</hi> comprehended ſuch an <hi>Intimate Time,</hi> that a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>firſt year,</hi> and a part alſo of the laſt <hi>ſix months,</hi> and the <hi>two years whole,</hi> comprehended the <hi>whole Time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus in the Parallel of the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> we may begin the <hi>first Year</hi> near the Time of the <hi>Star falling,</hi> when the <hi>Heaven</hi> became <hi>ſhut</hi> as to any <hi>Rain</hi> or <hi>Dew</hi> of pure <hi>Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal truth:</hi> but we moſt certainly know, that when there was a <hi>great ſound of Rain,</hi> as of the <hi>ſeven Thunders, viz.</hi> from 1517.

                  <p>The <hi>Hour, the Day, the Month, the Year</hi> reaches then to the <hi>taking Conſtantinople,</hi> and then going on, there remain juſt ſixty years to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> during which Time God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the <hi>Repentance</hi> of the other, or <hi>Weſtern</hi> part of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian World</hi> upon ſo great a Judgment on that <hi>Eaſtern</hi> part, in which the <hi>Western</hi> had ſo great an Intereſt by ſuch an Union in <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> while the <hi>Eaſtern Horn</hi> ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly affected, and aſpir'd to the ſame <hi>Primacy,</hi> and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality, and alſo were guilty of much the ſame <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> and as the Union was thus near, ſo the claim of Dominion by the <hi>Western Horn</hi> over the <hi>Eaſtern,</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bold, confident, and impatient of denyal, and ſubmitted to at that Councel of <hi>Florence,</hi> 1439, juſt before this killing the <hi>third part of men</hi> (as it were providentially) the more apparently to intereſt the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Antichriſtian State in this <hi>Woe,</hi> by the <hi>Greeks</hi> which made them one before men, as they were always before God.</p>
                  <p>Immediately after the ſevere cenſure upon the <hi>impenitency</hi> of the whole <hi>Beſtian State,</hi> compar'd with the very worſt of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in all manner of <hi>Idolatry, Sorcery</hi> of <hi>Seduction, Senſuality, Blood,</hi> hateful ſacrilegious <hi>Thefts, Cheats, Frauds,</hi> and <hi>Emunction</hi> of mens Eſtates on religious Pretences; on all theſe, I ſay, follows the divine <hi>Portraicture</hi> of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> under the next Head.</p>
                  <p>Now the Argument confirming this true Motion of things upon the Line of Time, as hath been ſtated, is very forcible, for it ſhews the deſcent of it ſo many years from that famous date of <hi>Mahometaniſm,</hi> at 622, ſo often mention'd; and it
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:41903:129"/> leads to a Period ſo very grand in <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> as the Expiration of the <hi>Grecian Monarchy;</hi> after that, The continuing <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency</hi> of the <hi>Weſtern Apoſtacy,</hi> and <hi>Eaſtern</hi> alſo, as we ſhall ſee, was ſo notorious, as to improve it ſelf, rather than to abate any thing.</p>
                  <p>This Impenitency, the very eſſential Character of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy</hi> to its final Deſtruction, draws the courſe of Time at this preſent Juncture down to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> or the laſt 180 years; in the mean while, the <hi>Turkiſh Woe</hi> continues its <hi>hour</hi> as an Evidence; That the 1260 <hi>days of the Witneſſes Prophecy in Sackcloth</hi> are not yet at an end; nor are they yet in full ſenſe <hi>riſen;</hi> nor can the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet</hi> yet have <hi>ſounded;</hi> becauſe the <hi>ſecond Woe,</hi> however in this face of Affairs now in the World, it ſeems upon its remove, is not yet gone, nor ſhall go; till all other things declar'd to come to paſs, before that ſhall have paſs'd, ſhall be ready to their proper motion alſo.</p>
                  <p>The People of God at the beginning of this <hi>Trumpet</hi> ſeem like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> under the <hi>Egyptian Slavery,</hi> when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of thoſe <hi>two Witneſſes, Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> appear'd to them; they <hi>cry out to Heaven,</hi> groaning under their <hi>Burdens:</hi> And there are many loud Sounds by way of Return from many eminent Servants of God, declaring his Judgments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>ſpiritual Egypt,</hi> and <hi>ſmiting it with Plagues</hi> in a free pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the <hi>Vials</hi> of this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> to be <hi>fulfill'd in their Seaſon;</hi> The <hi>Mahometan Woes</hi> were the <hi>first Plagues,</hi> and the <hi>Vials</hi> the laſt: and from this Time eſpecially, the Strokes of <hi>theſe Plagues,</hi> were as often, as it were, as <hi>they would,</hi> call'd down firſt by Prayer, and then foretold by the <hi>Witneſſes;</hi> but much more it ſhall be done, and much more their Duty to do thus in the next State of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> within the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> as we ſhall then ſhew.</p>
                  <p>By all which, by way of Remark, we may ſee, God did not <hi>leave himſelf without Witneſs</hi> of his dreadful Diſpleaſure upon the <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> of the <hi>Beſtian Earth,</hi> and <hi>Prince;</hi> againſt whom, theſe <hi>two Trumpets ſounded;</hi> the

                  <p>And even as the <hi>Grecian, Antichriſtian Empire</hi> was now deſolated, the <hi>third part of men kill'd,</hi> and the <hi>Imperial Seat</hi> turn'd to the <hi>Ottoman Port,</hi> ſo in a much higher degree of Judgment <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall then be <hi>burnt</hi> with a <hi>perpetual burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and not only the <hi>third part of men,</hi> but the <hi>whole reſt of men,</hi> who have not <hi>repented</hi> ſhall be <hi>kill'd with the Sword of Chriſt's Mouth,</hi> that is, ſo utterly ſubdued, and condemn'd, as never to return to <hi>Empire</hi> any more, and the <hi>Beast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> who had <hi>deceiv'd them, cast into the Lake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the time of the <hi>ſecond Trumpet, Rome</hi> had been thrown as a <hi>burning Mountain into the Sea;</hi> where it was not only preſerv'd, but as it were, new caſt for a future Glory under the <hi>Beast.</hi> But at that time <hi>its Smoak ſhall aſcend for ever,</hi> and its Glory ſink as a <hi>Mill-ſtone,</hi> not to be recover'd.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>third Trumpet</hi> many men <hi>died,</hi> but not ſo many, as to riſe to a <hi>third part of men,</hi> ſhewing the <hi>Imperial Beſtianiſm</hi>

                     <hi>This Section enters into the</hi> Half Time of the Reformation, <hi>and by the Agreement of the</hi> Prophecy <hi>with the</hi> Event, <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the Beginning and End of that Time; on</hi> Rev. c. 10.</head>
                  <p>HAving thus far travers'd this Line of Time, there remains yet the laſt part of it, or the <hi>Half Time;</hi> very great, and remarkable in its Dawn, but to be much more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in its Setting and Cloſe: and it is to be aſſign'd to the <hi>Reformation</hi> from 1517 to 1697.</p>
                  <p>We have found the order in which it hath come on, very clear, brought down by <hi>Prophecy,</hi> in Symbols ſo juſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to matters of Fact, and Events all along <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> firſt to the <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and from thence, by as unqueſtionable a Chain of Events, during that <hi>Apostacy,</hi> as hath been before deſcrib'd, till the <hi>Reformation;</hi> and now we ſhall find the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as admirably ſet out, and no other things in the whole courſe of Time, anſwering to each Repreſentation, as thoſe <hi>Cardinal</hi> Points of <hi>History</hi> do. What greater Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration then can we have, that we are upon the right ſenſe and ſcope of <hi>Prophecy?</hi> Since ſuch admirable Correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41903:131"/> as if we our ſelves by our own Judgments had been to contrive the one for the other, we could not, under Veils have deſired ſo much; and therefore they can no more be ſuſpected of chance, then that the Letters, Sillables, and Words of the <hi>Apocaliptick Prophecy,</hi> ſhould come out by chance into that exact <hi>System,</hi> wherein we now find them.</p>
                  <p>I pray therefore which of theſe grand Events can by Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be conteſted? or what fitter prophetical Symbols could be found out for them or in ſuch a Succeſſion? And ſo we ſhall find in this particular of the <hi>Reformation</hi> ſo recent and freſh in Hiſtory, and all moſt in Memory at this day; and at this day running on, ſo that the Inſtances of it are moſt notorious, confeſs'd, and even to be admired in the Wonders of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that brought it to paſs, and yet ſuſtain it.</p>
                  <p>When therefore the <hi>Beſtian</hi> or <hi>Antichriſtian Kingdom</hi> was coming ſo near its <hi>number,</hi> as that the <hi>Image of Supremacy</hi> had been made to the <hi>Beaſt</hi> at the 606; confirmed to it, and <hi>Life given to it,</hi> to <hi>ſpeak,</hi> and to <hi>cauſe, &amp;c.</hi> by the <hi>Lateran Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel</hi> at 649. come to its very <hi>number</hi> at 725.

                  <p>While all theſe things were, the Judgment of God in juſt Degrees and Meaſures purſued with Vengeance this <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Kindom.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt by <hi>Mahomets</hi> ſetting up his <hi>falſe Prophetiſm,</hi> as near the Supremacy, <hi>given by Phocas,</hi> as 622, to 606, by the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs</hi> or <hi>Mahometan Saracens,</hi> ready to enter their <hi>first five Months,</hi> and to <hi>strike as a Serpion,</hi> about the <hi>Time of the War,</hi> with the <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> eſpecially at their Death, 787; And to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> ſtrengthning it ſelf, they advanc'd into their ſecond <hi>five Months</hi> of <hi>hurting</hi> with the <hi>ſtings</hi> of their <hi>Tails,</hi> and when a winterly torpidneſs ſeiz'd them, then by the <hi>Turks</hi> as a far greater and more ſevere, as alſo

Therefore the Craſhings and Smoaking of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan</hi> Mountain at this Time, gives an alarm to the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of theſe things: and however the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by its Contributions, concurr with the <hi>Ten Kings</hi> to the <hi>paſſing away</hi> of that <hi>Woe;</hi> yet let it certainly know, that at that very ſame time, and by thoſe very <hi>Ten Kings</hi> falling off from it, its own <hi>Decarchy</hi> or <hi>Ten-horn'd Supremacy,</hi> ſhall fall into the Duſt alſo.</p>
                  <p>For, as we may be aſſured, The <hi>Reformation,</hi> the <hi>riſing of the Witneſſes,</hi> are not yet at their top, becauſe that <hi>Woe</hi> is not yet <hi>paſs'd;</hi> ſo we may be aſſur'd, All the <hi>Symbols,</hi> and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems</hi> of the <hi>Antichristian City,</hi> and <hi>Prince,</hi> as roll'd down from their height, and of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ riſing,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though being future, we cannot ſo certainly expound them, yet they ſhall in their ſignificancy be <hi>fulfill'd,</hi> and made good to the utmoſt, as thoſe have been before them, which we more fully comprehend by <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> And that, all muſt be <hi>fulfill'd</hi> within the 180 Years from 1517, or from the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> begun then, which muſt be by 1697.

By the expreſs Allowance of <hi>time</hi> at large, till the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet:</hi> For when it is ſaid, <hi>Time ſhall be no more; But in the days of the ſeventh Trumpet All ſhall be finiſhed;</hi> It is a certain Implication, Till then there ſhall be ſome Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Time,</hi> although not a <hi>whole Time,</hi> nor ſo much as a <hi>whole Half time,</hi> nor any <hi>Time</hi> at all of the Elevation, Intimate Time was of, or of a <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſo entire to the <hi>Beast.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whoever then knows theſe <hi>two Oaths</hi> will compare them; whoever compares them will conclude, There muſt have been before the <hi>laſt Oath, Time, Times,</hi> and ſome part of <hi>Half-time,</hi> that the <hi>first Oath</hi> may be true; he will alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, There can be no more than <hi>Half-time,</hi> and not that whole; for there can be only an imperfect Remnant of <hi>time</hi> after this laſt <hi>Oath:</hi> elſe, How can this <hi>laſt Oath</hi> be true?</p>
                  <p>And yet it is impoſſible any part of the 1260 Days, or <hi>three times</hi> and <hi>a half</hi> equal to them, ſhould run beyond the end of the <hi>ſixth,</hi> or the very entrance of the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet;</hi> for it is expreſly ſaid, when the <hi>Witneſſes aſcended,</hi> which they could not do till the end of the 1260 <hi>Days Prophecy in Sackcloth,</hi> the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet</hi> immediately <hi>ſounded.</hi> Thus theſe 1260 Days are every way bounded by the <hi>ſeventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet:</hi>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:41903:138"/> they cannot end ſooner; for then there would be <hi>Time</hi> after the <hi>Oath,</hi> more than the <hi>Half-time</hi> and the <hi>ſeventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet not ſound,</hi> which muſt not be. And they cannot run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the firſt of the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> becauſe they muſt needs end when the <hi>VVitneſſes</hi> ſo perfectly <hi>riſe</hi> as to <hi>aſcend;</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid; which is before the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> or 1697.</p>
                  <p>Whither then muſt theſe 1260 <hi>days</hi> reflow from the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth trumpet</hi> beginning to <hi>ſound?</hi> Into the ſpaces of what <hi>trumpet</hi> or <hi>trumpets,</hi> as into their proper Channel? Into the <hi>ſixth trumpet</hi> they certainly do, but that cannot receive them all; for allowing after the <hi>taking of Conſtantinople</hi> ſixty four Years for the making the Experiment of the <hi>Impenitency</hi> of the <hi>rest of Men,</hi> the <hi>half-day</hi> immediately appear'd: joyning then the <hi>half-time</hi> or <hi>day</hi> of 180 Years to 64, that Space re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives only 244 by vertue of the <hi>Mahometan Hour,</hi> or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Space allowed them, beyond their <hi>Day, Month,</hi> and <hi>Year.</hi> To which <hi>day, month, year,</hi> being 395, add the 244, and they are 639, which is the whole, and that a very long ſpace of the <hi>ſixth trumpet,</hi> delaying the <hi>ſeventh</hi> alſo (that <hi>comes</hi> and <hi>quickly</hi> diſpatches) to <hi>hereafter.</hi> But ſeeing this <hi>trumpet</hi> holds but 639, ſomewhat above half of the 1260 Days, they muſt be thrown back into the <hi>fifth trumpet;</hi> which having room but for 435, as we have before found, from the <hi>Hegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> 622, the remaining 186 muſt regurgitate into the <hi>four firſt trumpets,</hi> where they find juſt entertainment to 437; even as all theſe accounting forward determine from ſpace to ſpace at the ſame 1697.</p>
                  <p>Turning things thus every way then, we may find, how the order of this <hi>Apocalyptical Prophecy</hi> lies upon this Line of Time; and how, and with what ſecret Invitations, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters or Dates of Time are call'd after the Voice of the <hi>Lyon,</hi> and the <hi>Thunders-Voices,</hi> at the <hi>Reformation</hi> to every <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Symbol,</hi> either of the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of the <hi>Servants of God,</hi> or of the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> and <hi>Tyranny of the Beſtian Kingdom,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven with them; and firſt, why, although the Characters of Time began at the Beginning of the <hi>trumpets,</hi> they are not
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41903:138"/> given till after the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the <hi>Reformation, Chapt.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>THE laſt <hi>Line of Time</hi> upon the <hi>grand Line</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s 2300 <hi>Ev. Mor.</hi> ſtretches out it ſelf beyond the ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated <hi>Prophetical Line</hi> we have been upon; and yet it is moſt juſtly, and according to the Reaſon of the Line to be joyned with it, becauſe the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> hath in <hi>Daniel</hi> ſo joyned to 1260, 30 more, making 1290, and then 45, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king 1335, as hath been ſo often obſerv'd: ſo that from hence, however joyn'd, riſes a diſtinct Line of 75 Years, conſiſting of its leſſer Diſtinctions, 30, and 45.</p>
                  <p>And with great Wiſdom and Deſign they are undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus joyn'd, and yet diſtinguiſh'd; for hereby is ſhewn, 1. That it is the ſame <hi>principal Line</hi> of 2300 Ev. Mor. thus protended; 2. That the managements of Divine Power, as to the Divine Kingdom, are of a diſtinct nature from what they were, any part, even the laſt and beſt part, (that is, the <hi>Half-time)</hi> of the 1260 Days, or ſince the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and yet that there is an Agreement too; ſo that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> is diſtinctly advanc'd in the firſt 30, above the State of it along the <hi>Half-time,</hi> and ſtill farther and higher advanc'd in the laſt Diſtinction, or the <hi>forty five;</hi> and yet that the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> does not <hi>appear in Glory,</hi> until the End of the 1335: all which appears very plainly both in <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptick Prophecy:</hi> where ſeeing the <hi>Voices</hi> and the <hi>Vials</hi> come after the 1260 Days, we may conclude by the Union, and by the Diſtinction together, That the latter end of the <hi>ſixth Trumpet</hi> adheres cloſe to the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> and then by the <hi>Voices</hi> firſt, and the <hi>Vials</hi> after them [both of the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet]</hi> following ſo cloſe one upon another, and by the Bleſſed State coming upon all, we may be moſt aſſur'd, the <hi>Voices</hi> and the <hi>Vials</hi> anſwer to the Thirty and the Forty five Years
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41903:142"/> of Surpluſage to the 1260 Days, ſo diſtinguiſh'd and ſo conjoyn'd.</p>
                  <p>Now that theſe <hi>Voices</hi> and <hi>Vials</hi> of the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet</hi> are yet to come, and to come in the Order laid down, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Time laid down; theſe ſix Things may indubitably convince us:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We may be fully aſſur'd, nothing ſo great, as the <hi>ſeven Thunders,</hi> could be heard before the <hi>Reformation,</hi> ſo high, ſo loud for the <hi>Kingdom of Christ;</hi> ſo they muſt be with the <hi>Reformation</hi> beginning.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is moſt apparently a ſpace allowed for the <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> remaining <hi>ſeal'd,</hi> after their <hi>Voices uttered;</hi> which ſpace hath ſo great reaſon, as hath been given, to be rated at a Half-time, or 180 Years, and ſo cannot be run out yet ſince the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nothing ſo eminent ſince the <hi>Reformation,</hi> as the Fall of the <hi>Tenth of the Great City,</hi> or the <hi>Turkiſh Woe</hi> ceaſing, (whatever hopes now appear,) nor of the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet</hi> ſo cloſely lynck'd with both, hath yet been ſeen.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Oath of Christ,</hi> that <hi>Time ſhould be no more,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly allow ſuch a ſpace of Time, or Delay, as the <hi>Half-time</hi> after Time, Times, Half-Time, within the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet;</hi> or indeed, any Time at all, wherein every thing ſhould not be in motion, and zealous of <hi>finiſhing the Myſtery of God,</hi> and that within ſo ſhort a Time, as 75 Years: ſo that as the <hi>Voices</hi> and <hi>Vials</hi> cannot have yet been ſince the <hi>Reformation,</hi> ſo they cannot take up above 75 Years after it. For to ſhew them quick, they are ſtyl'd <hi>Voices,</hi> ſoon given, and <hi>Vials</hi> ſuddenly <hi>pour'd out;</hi> and what is quicker than the <hi>Voice</hi> of God's <hi>Thunder,</hi> than the <hi>Spouts</hi> and <hi>Cataracts of Heaven?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. If there be <hi>ſeven Voices</hi> or <hi>Thunders,</hi> they muſt needs unite with the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> and the <hi>ſeven Vials</hi> muſt iſſue from the <hi>ſeventh Voice,</hi> or elſe the admirable Contexture of this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> its <hi>Symmetry,</hi> and <hi>Harmony,</hi> muſt needs be loſt; as therefore the <hi>ſeventh Seal</hi> comprehends the <hi>ſeven</hi>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:41903:142"/> 
                     <hi>Trumpets,</hi> during which the <hi>Kingdom</hi> remains <hi>ſeal'd;</hi> even ſo muſt the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet, the Voices,</hi> and to ſhew the <hi>Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> are <hi>ſeven Voices,</hi> the <hi>ſeven Vials</hi> are <hi>fill'd</hi> from the <hi>Blood of the Wine-preſs of the ſeventh Voice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is moſt impoſſible the <hi>Beſtian</hi> or <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Power ſhould be in ſuch a State as at this day it is; If the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> with its <hi>Voices</hi> and <hi>Vials,</hi> had made their Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on it, it muſt needs have been torn and rent in pieces thereby.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe that ſo illuſtrious End of the <hi>ſixth Trumpet</hi> and the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet</hi> are to come, and that the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet</hi> is ſo expreſly ſtyl'd <hi>Myſtery,</hi> I ſhall with all Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Modeſty, and Brevity, undertake not any thing in their Explication, as to the very manner, or preciſe ſenſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, but only in the general, demonſtrate their Order and Sequence, and obſerve their neceſſary main Importance: but whether even that <hi>Fall of the Tenth of the City,</hi> and the concomitant <hi>mighty Works,</hi> do not with a great notice of themſelves, only given at the end of the ſixth, iſſue into the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet,</hi> and ſo are gradually fulfill'd in the <hi>Voices</hi> and the <hi>Vials,</hi> and how the <hi>Beſtian</hi> Power, or the <hi>ſpiritual Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>Egypt,</hi> is ſo much as kept in a State of Being or Exiſtence at all, and ſurvives (as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> of old) under ſuch <hi>Voices</hi> and <hi>Vials</hi> to the laſt, or as the City where our <hi>Lord was crucified</hi> did under ſuch a <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and a courſe of <hi>Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Prophecies fulfilling</hi> upon it, till de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd by <hi>Titus,</hi> I confeſs my ſelf unable to account; but muſt leave it to that Time it ſelf, that will be ſo full of Light to explain it.</p>
                  <p>But that the <hi>Prophecy</hi> gives us an orderly courſe of <hi>ſeven Voices,</hi> although, in reverence, as it were, of the <hi>Prophecy</hi> it ſelf to its own Type of the <hi>Thunders</hi> once <hi>ſeal'd,</hi> they and their Order is ſo much cover'd, I ſhall thus argue:</p>
                  <p>There are in this <hi>Apocal. Prophecy, ch.</hi> 14. ſeven diſtinct Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues <label type="milestone">

From hence it appears they concert with all the <hi>Apocalyptick Sevens,</hi> in which Number the whole <hi>Prophecy</hi> is all along con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed.</p>
                  <p>To each of theſe, there is applied either a <hi>Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>

                  <p>To ſhew there is a Connexion of the <hi>Seven,</hi> when there had been no mention of <hi>any Angel</hi> in the <hi>first Voice;</hi> yet it is <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The very Importance of each <hi>Voice</hi> carries a Succeſſion to <label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt then enquire from whence theſe <hi>Voices</hi> riſe and ſpring, and we may find three Origins of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They riſe from the <hi>Church of Philadelphia,</hi> whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Interval, or Support of the Line of Time, is at the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Trumpet,</hi> as hath been affirmed; And it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt ſet it an open door,</hi> viz. <hi>of divine Doctrine,</hi> reaching to <hi>Chriſt's Kingdom.</hi> So the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls the Propagation of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They ſpring from the <hi>ſeven Thunders,</hi> that <hi>uttered their Voices</hi> but, as not in due time to proceed, nor in the order of the <hi>Apocal. Sevens,</hi> were then <hi>ſealed,</hi> but are now <hi>written.</hi> The firſt <hi>Voice</hi> therefore, as the <hi>Voice of Thunder,</hi> allies the whole Courſe of them to the <hi>Thunders;</hi> and the Perſons from whom the Voice of the firſt <hi>Thunder</hi> proceeds, had the Name of the <hi>Lambs Father Written;</hi> which <hi>Number</hi> was firſt under Seal at the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> beginning; then they ſhewed themſelves at the <hi>Thunders,</hi> but immediately were <hi>ſeal'd</hi> again, and now <hi>unſeal'd,</hi> and <hi>written</hi> at the <hi>Thunders unſeal'd</hi> and <hi>written</hi> in theſe <hi>Voices.</hi> So in the <hi>fifth Voice, Write.</hi> Now <hi>Writing</hi> in this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> as contrary to the <hi>Sealing,</hi> ſignifies an Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſencing of Things; ſo <hi>unſealing</hi> and <hi>writing</hi> moſt naturally begin together.</p>

                  <p>I have thus far ſettled this <hi>divine Sett of Viſions,</hi> or the <hi>ſeven Voices,</hi> as they conduct the courſe of Time, or the firſt <hi>thirty</hi> of the <hi>ſeventy five Years;</hi> which are not indeed <hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> given in this <hi>Apocalyptical Prophecy,</hi> either for the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Prophecy</hi> or for the diſtincteſt ſecuring the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of that alone given <hi>Number,</hi> the great <hi>prophetical</hi> Line before diſcourſed, which fall upon a Time of greateſt Obſcurity, and of all other leaſt diſcernable; and laſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe this Time, when it comes, will be fulleſt of Light.
